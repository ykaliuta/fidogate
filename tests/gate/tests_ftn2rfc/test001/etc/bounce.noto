Subject: Returned mail: No valid To line found in message

   ----- Transcript of session follows -----

Your mail

   From: %f @ %F
   To:   %t @ %T
   Date: %d
   Subj: %s

didn't contain a To line at the very beginning of the message.
Therefore it could not be delivered.

Please insert a line similar to

   To: user@host.do.main

next time!

If your message contains a "To:" line, the most common errors are
additional (empty) lines before the "To:" line, extra spaces before
"To:" or using "To :".

If you want to send mail to a local user at this system please omit
the To line and put the user or real name into the FIDO header.
