This directory contains the sendmail m4 configuration files from the
RedHat 4.1 (Vanderbilt) / sendmail 8.8.5 release with some additional
config files for FIDOGATE support.

See cf/*.mc for a sample setup with FIDOGATE.

sendmail m4 configuration tree, these are:

mailer/ftn.m4	FIDOGATE ftn mailer definitions (ftn, ftni, ftna, ftno)
mailer/ffx.m4	FIDOGATE ffx mailer definition
cf/*		various example config files, mailertables etc.
