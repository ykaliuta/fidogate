Warning: configuration changed a lot since release 3.9.7, so using an
old configuration without any changes for release 4 will cause
problems.

In particular, Roland's fgpack script (see doc/Fido-Point-HOWTO) does
*NOT* work with the release 4 ftnpack!!!

As of FIDOGATE 4.2.5, the source can be compiled with the Cygnus

Contributing patches:

PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING RULES FOR CONTRIBUTING PATCHES:

* No changes to the indentation, white space etc. No beautifying,
  please.

* Supply only context diffs (command diff -u), not complete changed
  files.

* Supply patches against the latest version of FIDOGATE, or even
  better against the FIDOGATE CVS repository.

If you do not follow these simple rules, it is quite likely that I'll
not integrate your patches.
