~From: rs@mirror.TMC.COM (Rich Salz)
~Newsgroups: net.sources
~Subject: Small shell-style pattern matcher
Message-ID: <596@mirror.TMC.COM>
~Date: 27 Nov 86 00:06:40 GMT

There have been several regular-expression subroutines and one or two
filename-globbing routines in mod.sources.  They handle lots of
complicated patterns.  This small piece of code handles the *?[]\
wildcard characters the way the standard Unix(tm) shells do, with the
addition that "[^.....]" is an inverse character class -- it matches
any character not in the range ".....".  Read the comments for more
info.

For my application, I had first ripped off a copy of the "glob" routine
from within the find source, but that code is bad news:  it recurses
on every character in the pattern.  I'm putting this replacement in the
public domain.  It's small, tight, and iterative.  Compile with -DTEST
to get a test driver.  After you're convinced it works, install in
whatever way is appropriate for you.

I would like to hear of bugs, but am not interested in additions; if I
were, I'd use the code I mentioned above.
