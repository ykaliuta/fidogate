 1. Convince Martin Junius to include AI extensions. :)

 2. Merge AI extensions with FidoGate 4.3.x.

 3. Think about more complete/correct/transparent MIME support
    (maybe, incorporate MIME support from ifmail-TX).

 4. At present, Fidogate's configuration files are rather big. For example,
    `hosts' file, especially if we include world nodelist into it (to support
    hub routing).
    May be, translate some Fidogate's config files (which consist of tables:
    aliases, areas[.bbs], fareas.bbs, hosts, routing, etc...) to the db format.
    Probably, one should simply write `compilers' of these files to .db and
    change accordingly the work with these files in Fidogate.
    However, I hope that this will be done by Martin. :)
