 0. All changes are delimitered with corresponding #define's, which
    allows one to switch separate features. This also makes the
    changes localized and more clear.

 1. Added `-a' key to hosts file (see example). This key is necessary
    in situations when a message from internet address, for which there
    is a mapping in a `hosts' file to some fidonet address, is being sent
    to fidonet area, the ^AREPLYTO and Origin fields should contain "real"
    fidonet address, but not a gate's address. ^AMSGID is also generated
    if Message-Id is absent in the original message, using "real" fidonet
    address.
    To switch this on, `#define AI_1' in config.h.

 2. Fixed alias problem in ftn2rfc.c module.
    Fixed alias problem in aliases.c module.
    Added extended aliases. New format of aliases file is backward
    compatible with original format, i.e. the behavior for old configs
    is exactly as for unmodified algorithm (as far as I was able to test :).
    See README.ai.alias for more information.
    To switch this on, `#define AI_2' in config.h.

 3. Added `DeleteSeenBy' and `DeletePath' variables to config.main file
    (see example).
    To switch this on, `#define AI_3' in config.h.

 4. Added UNICODE patch from Alexander E. Pevzner <pzz@pzz.msk.ru>.
    Fixed UNICODE quoted-printable bug in message.c (Andy Igoshin <ai@vsu.ru>).
    Fixed quoted-printable bug (added processing of Soft Line Breaks
    (Rule #5 of RFC1521) - `=' at the end of QP-line) in rfc2ftn.c, mime.c,
    unicode.c (Andy Igoshin <ai@vsu.ru>). To switch this on, `#define AI_9' in
    config.h.
    Fixed a bug of processing 8bit characters in `CHRS:' kludge in unicode.c
    (these 8bit chars are illegal there, but without a fix ftn2rfc would crash
    on some PKTs which have this broken CHRS). (Andy Igoshin <ai@vsu.ru>).

 5. Added check on 8bit in subject, origin and tearline.
    To switch this on, `#define AI_5' in config.h.

 6. Added `AddressIsLocalForXPost' variable in config.common file
    (see example). In this variable one can specify wildcards to determine
    which users are allowed to crosspost to areas marked with `-l' flag
    in `areas' file.
    To switch this on, `#define AI_6' in config.h.

 7. Added `UseXMailerForTearline', `UseUseragentForTearline' and
    `UseXNewsreaderForTearline' variables to config.gate file (see example).
    This allows generation of `Tearline' field in .pkt files from field
    `User-Agent:' or `X-Newsreader:' contained in RFC message (like
    `X-FTN-Tearline:' header). Priority is: `X-FTN-Tearline:', `User-Agent:',
    `X-Newsreader:' for news messages and `X-FTN-Tearline:', `X-Mailer:' for
    mail messages. If these variables are not present in config.gate, we do
    not process the corresponding fields in RFC message.
    To switch this on, `#define AI_7' in config.h.

 8. Added ACL support. This feature allows one to describe the correspondence
    between sender's email address and newsgroups to which this sender is
    allowed to write. One can use wildcards as email and newsgroups. The
    newsgroups list is in INN like style. See the comments in `acl' file in
    the `examples' directory for further information. 
    To switch this on, `#define AI_8' in config.h.
