TODO list for FIDOGATE tests:

	* ftnpack:

	  - packet file names not ending in .pkt on command line
            correctly archived as something.pkt?

	  OK: ftnpack uses the filename of the packet file for the
	  archive and doesn't generate a new one. If filenames are
	  given on the command line, these will be used for the
	  archive, regardless whether they end in .pkt or not.

	  Maybe add a new option to always generate a new packet name
	  ending in .pkt.


	* ftntoss:

	  - new tosser 4D EchoMail handling as of 4.2.0 for a boss
	    node tosser with some points.

	  OK: no problems found.
