Status of this document:

     This FTS (FidoNet(r) Technical Standard) specifies an optional
     standard for the FidoNet community.  Implementation of the
     protocols defined in this document is not mandatory,  but all
     implementations of these protocols are expected to adhere to this
     standard.  Distribution of this document is unlimited.

MSGID

     A MSGID line consists of the string "^AMSGID:" (where ^A is a
     control-A (hex 01) and the double-quotes are not part of the
     string),  followed by a space,  the address of the originating
     system,  and a serial number unique to that message on the
     originating system,  i.e.:

          ^AMSGID: origaddr serialno

     The originating address should be specified in a form that
     constitutes a valid return address for the originating network.   
     If the originating address is enclosed in double-quotes,  the
     entire string between the beginning and ending double-quotes is 
     considered to be the orginating address.  A double-quote character
     within a quoted address is represented by by two consecutive
     double-quote characters.  The serial number may be any eight
     character hexadecimal number,  as long as it is unique - no two
     messages from a given system may have the same serial number
     within a three years.  The manner in which this serial number is
     generated is left to the implementor.


REPLY

     A REPLY line consists of the string "^AREPLY:" (where ^A is a
     control-A (hex 01) and the double-quotes are not part of the
     string),  followed by a space, and the origaddr and serialno
     fields of the MSGID line of the message to which this message is a
     reply,  i.e.:

        ^AREPLY: origaddr serialno

     The origaddr and serialno fields must be identical to the
     corresponding fields in the MSGID of the message to which this
     message is a reply.  A REPLY line is never generated in a 
     message that is a reply to a message that does not contain a
     MSGID line.


GENERAL

     MSGID and REPLY lines should be placed before the text body of the
     message in which they appear.

     Finally,  a MSGID is generated only at the time of message
     creation.  An existing MSGID and/or REPLY should never be stripped
     from a message passing through an intermediate system.  No system
     should ever add an MSGID and/or REPLY to,  or modify an existing
     MSGID / REPLY contained in,  a message not originating on that
     system.
