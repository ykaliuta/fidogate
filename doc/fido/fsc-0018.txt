                       Status of Current FidoNet Standards
                                 March 30, 1988
     
     

   1. FSC-0001 (was FSC001-9) is the basic falback standard for use on
      FidoNet.  All mailers must be able to perform this protocol should
      other negotiations fail.

      FSC-0001 describes transmitted data structures, record and message
      formats, as well as the actual transmission protocols used.

   2. FSC-0006 describes a capability exchange protocol (YooHoo/2U2),
      which allows two FidoNet systems to dynamically negotiate (at the
      start of a session) which of a list of protocols is to be used.

      FSC-0006 is used as the base for protocol experimentation on
      FidoNet.

   3. FSC-0010 describes the transmitted form of EchoMail.  Lack of other
      detailed specifications led us to extract this document from the
      documentation of a FidoNet utility, with the kind permission of its
      author, Bob Hartman.

      FSC-0010 describes echo history, topologies, and message formats.

   4. ARCmail is as specified in the System Enhancement Associates
      documentation for ARCmail version 0.6.

      It consists of ARCed files named
          nnnnmmmm.dd#
      where nnnn is (orignet-destnet) in hex, mmmm is (orignode-destnode)
      in hex, dd is a day of the week in the form MO, TU, WE,TH, FR, SA,
      or SU, and # is a decimal digit.

      These ARCmail files consist of multiple FSC-0001 mail packets of
      multiple EchoMail messages with AREA:<areaname> lines etc.  These
      packets are named
          ddhhmmssxx.PKT
      where dd is the day of the month in decimal, hhmmss is the hour
      minute and second in decimal, and xx is hundreths of a second in
      decimal.
