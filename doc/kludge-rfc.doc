This document describes the various ^ARFC kludges for "tunneling"
RFC822 headers thru FIDO messages.


^ARFC: <lvl> <fmt>

	Indicates the start of the ^ARFC kludges and the type:

	<lvl>	0	no RFC headers at all
		1	subset of the original RFC headers
		2	all original RFC headers

	<fmt>	lines	lines, no text filling
		fill	unformatted text to be filled
		0	= lines
		1	= fill



^ARFC-Xxxx: abc

	RFC header Xxxx:


^ARFC\ def

	Continued RFC header (line break for header lines > XX chars).
	Is this really needed or just a tribute to broken FTN
	software? Not implemented in FIDOGATE 4.0.


^ARFC- abc

	Continued RFC header, header line starting with white space
