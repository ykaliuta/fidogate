<P>
          This  document  is  intended  to  become  an Internet Draft.
          Internet Drafts are working documents of the Internet  
          Engineering  Task  Force  (IETF),  its  Areas,  and  its Working
          Groups.  Note that other groups may also distribute  working
          documents as Internet Drafts.
<P>
          Internet  Drafts  are draft documents valid for a maximum of
          six months.  Internet Drafts may be  updated,  replaced,  or
          obsoleted  by other documents at any time.  It is not appropriate 
          to use Internet Drafts as reference  material  or  to
          cite  them  other  than  as  a  "working  draft" or "work in
          progress".
<P>
          Please check the I-D  abstract  listing  contained  in  each
          Internet Draft directory to learn the current status of this
          or any other Internet Draft.  (Actually, this  draft  is  at
          too early a stage to even be listed there yet.)
<P>
          It is hoped that a later version of this Draft will obsolete
          <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> 
          RFC 1036 </A> and will become an Internet standard.
<P>
          References to the "successor to this  Draft"  refer  not  to
          later  versions  of this draft, but to a hypothetical future
          rewrite of this Draft (in the same way that this Draft is  a
          rewrite of <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A>).
<P>
          Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

<P>
          This Draft defines the format and procedures for interchange
          of network news articles.  It is hoped that a later  version
          of this Draft will obsolete 
          <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> 
          RFC 1036 </A>, reflecting more recent
          experience and accommodating future directions.
<P>
          Network news articles resemble mail messages but are  broadcast  
          to potentially-large audiences, using a flooding algorithm that 
          propagates one copy to each interested  host  (or
          group thereof), typically stores only one copy per host, and
          does not require any central  administration  or  systematic
          registration  of  interested users.  Network news originated
          as the medium  of  communication  for  Usenet,  circa  1980.
          Since  then  Usenet has grown explosively, and many Internet
          sites participate in it.  In addition, the  news  technology
          is now in widespread use for other purposes, on the Internet
          and elsewhere.
<P>
          This Draft primarily codifies and organizes  existing  practice.   
          A few small extensions have been added in an attempt
          to solve problems that are considered serious.  Major extensions 
          (e.g. cryptographic authentication) that need significant 
          development effort are left to be undertaken  as  independent 
          efforts.

<P>
          Network  news articles resemble mail messages but are broadcast 
          to potentially-large audiences, using a flooding  algorithm  that
            propagates one copy to each interested host (or
          groups thereof), typically stores only one  copy  per  host,
          and  does  not require any central administration or systematic 
          registration of interested users.  Network news  originated as the
           medium of communication for Usenet, circa 1980.
          Since then Usenet has grown explosively, and  many  Internet
          sites  participate  in it.  In addition, the news technology
          is now in widespread use for other purposes, on the Internet
          and elsewhere.
<P>
          The  earliest  news  interchange used the so-called "A News"
          article  format.   Shortly  thereafter,  an  article  format
          vaguely  resembling  Internet  mail  was  devised  and  used
          briefly.  Both of those  formats  are  completely  obsolete;
          they  are  documented  in  appendix A for historical reasons
          only.  With publication of 
          <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc0850.gz"> 
          RFC 850 </A> [rrr] in 1983, news articles  came  to closely 
          resemble Internet mail messages, with
          some restrictions and some  additional  headers.   
          <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> 
          RFC 1036 </A>
          [rrr]  in 1987 updated 
          <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc0850.gz"> 
          RFC 850 </A> without making major changes.
<P>
          In the intervening five years, the 
          <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> 
          RFC 1036 </A>  article  format
          has  proven  quite  satisfactory,  although minor extensions
          appear desirable to match recent developments in areas  such
          as  multi-media  mail.  
          <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> 
          RFC 1036 </A> itself has not proven quite
          so satisfactory.  It is often  rather  vague  and  does  not
          address  some  issues  at  all;  this has caused significant
          interoperability problems at times, and implementations have
          diverged  somewhat.  Worse, although it was intended primarily
           to document existing  practice,  it  did  not  precisely
          match  existing  practice even at the time it was published,
          and the deviations have grown since.
<P>
          This Draft attempts to specify the format of  articles,  and
          the  procedures  used  to exchange them and process them, in
          sufficient detail to allow full interoperability.  In  addition,
            some  tentative suggestions are made about directions
          for future development, in an attempt to  avert  unnecessary
          divergence  and  consequent loss of interoperability.  Major
          extensions (e.g.  cryptographic  authentication)  that  need
          significant  development effort are left to be undertaken as
          independent efforts.
<P>

   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> One question this all may raise is:  why  is
   there  no  News-Version header, analogous to MIMEVersion, specifying a
    version number corresponding
   to  this specification?  The answer is: it doesn't
   appear  to  be  useful,  given  news's   backwardcompatibility  
   constraints.   The  major  use of a
   version number  is  indicating  which  of  several
   INCOMPATIBLE  interpretations  is  relevant.   The
   impossibility of orchestrating any sort of  simultaneous change over
    news's installed base makes it
   necessary to avoid such incompatible  changes  (as
   opposed  to extensions) entirely.  MIME has a version number mostly 
   because it introduced incompatible  changes  to  the  interpretation 
    of several
   "Content-"  headers.   This  Draft   attempts   no
   changes  in interpretation and it appears doubtful
   that future Drafts will find it feasible to introduce any.
<P>
   <B>UNRESOLVED ISSUE:</B>  Should  this  be reconsidered?
   Only if the header has SPECIFIC IDENTIFIABLE  uses
   today.  Otherwise it's just useless added bulk.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          As  in  this  Draft's  predecessors, the exact means used to
          transmit articles from one host to another is not specified.
          NNTP  [rrr]  is probably the most common transmission method
          on the Internet, but a number of others are known to  be  in
          use,  including  the UUCP protocol [rrr] extensively used in
          the early days of Usenet and still much used on its  fringes
          today.
<P>
          Several  of  the mechanisms described in this Draft may seem
          somewhat strange or even bizarre at first reading.  As  with
          Internet  mail, there is no reasonable possibility of updating
           the entire installed base of news software promptly,  so
          interoperability  with  old  software  is  crucial  and will
          remain so.  Compatibility with existing practice and robustness 
           in  an  imperfect world necessarily take priority over
          elegance.

           about this Draft's
          relationship to MAIL.  "MIME" is short for

<P>
          "ASCII"  is  short  for "the ANSI X3.4 character set" [rrr].
          While "ASCII" is often misused to refer to various character
          sets  somewhat similar to X3.4, in this Draft, "ASCII" means
          X3.4 and only X3.4.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> The name is traditional (to the point  where
   the  ANSI standard sanctions it) even though it is
   no longer an acronym for the name of the standard.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  ASCII,  X3.4,  contains 128 characters, not
   all of them printable.  Character sets  with  more
   characters   are  not  ASCII,  although  they  may
   include it as a subset.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Certain words used to define the significance of  individual
          requirements are capitalized.  "<B>MUST</B>" means that the item is
          an absolute  requirement  of  the  specification.   "<B>SHOULD</B>"
          means that the item is a strong recommendation: there may be
          valid reasons to ignore it  in  unusual  circumstances,  but
          this  should  be  done  only after careful study of the full
          implications and a firm conclusion  that  it  is  necessary,
          because  there are serious disadvantages to doing so.  "MAY"
          means that the item is truly optional, and implementors  and
          users  are warned that conformance is possible but not to be
          relied on.
<P>
          The term "compliant", applied to implementations etc., indicates 
           satisfaction  of  all  relevant  "<B>MUST</B>"  and "<B>SHOULD</B>"
          requirements.  The term "conditionally compliant"  indicates
          satisfaction  of all relevant "<B>MUST</B>" requirements but 
          violation of at least one relevant "<B>SHOULD</B>" requirement.
<P>
          This Draft contains explanatory notes  using  the  following
          format.   These  may be skipped by persons interested solely
          in the content of the specification.   The  purpose  of  the
          notes  is to explain why choices were made, to place them in
          context, or to suggest possible implementation techniques.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> While such explanatory notes may seem superfluous 
    in  principle,  they  often help the lessthan-omniscient reader grasp the 
     purpose  of  the
   specification and the constraints involved.  Given
   the limitations of natural language  for  descriptive  purposes, this
    improves the probability that
   implementors and users will  understand  the  true
   intent  of  the  specification  in cases where the
   wording is not entirely clear.

          All numeric values are given  in  decimal  unless  otherwise

<P>
          Although the mechanisms specified  in  this  Draft  are  all
          described  in prose, most are also described formally in the
          modified BNF notation of 
          <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc0822.gz"> 
          RFC 822 </A>.  Implementors will need to
          be  familiar  with  this  notation  to fully understand this
          specification, and are referred to 
          <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc0822.gz"> 
          RFC 822 </A>  for  a  complete
          explanation  of  the modified BNF notation.  Here is a brief
          illustrative example:
<P>
<PRE>
   sentence  = clause *( punct clause ) "."
   punct     = ":" / ";"
   clause    = 1*word [ "(" clause ")" / "," 1*word ]
   word      = &lt;any English word&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
          This defines a sentence as some clauses separated by  puncts
          and  ended  by  a period, a punct as a colon or semicolon, a
          clause as at least one &lt;word&gt; optionally followed by  either
          a  parenthesized  clause  or  a  comma and at least one more
          &lt;word&gt;, and a &lt;word&gt; as (informally) any English  word. 
            &lt;&gt;
          are  used to enclose names when (and only when) distinguishing 
          them from surrounding text is useful.  The full form  of
          the  repetition  notation  is &lt;m&gt;"*"&lt;n&gt;&lt;thing&gt;,
           denoting &lt;m&gt;
          through &lt;n&gt; repetitions of &lt;thing&gt;; &lt;m&gt;  
          defaults  to  zero,
          &lt;n&gt;  to  infinity, and the "*" and &lt;n&gt; can be omitted
           if &lt;m&gt;
          and &lt;n&gt; are equal, so 1*word is one or more  words,  1*5word
          is one through five words, and 2word is exactly two words.
<P>
          The  character  "\"  is not special in any way in this notation.
<P>
          This Draft is intended  to  be  self-contained;  all  syntax
          rules  used in it are defined within it, and a rule with the
          same name as one found in MAIL does not necessarily have the
          same  definition.   The lexical layer of MAIL is NOT, repeat
          NOT, used in this  Draft,  and  its  presence  must  not  be
          assumed;  notably,  this  Draft  spells out all places where
          white space is permitted/required and all places where  constructs
           resembling MAIL comments can occur.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  News  parsers  historically  have been much
   less permissive than MAIL parsers.

<P>
          The term "character set", wherever it is used in this Draft,
          refers to a coded character set, in the sense of ISO character set
           standardization work, and must not be misinterpreted
          as meaning merely "a set of characters".
<P>
          In this Draft, ASCII character 32 is referred to as "blank";
          the word "space" has a more generic meaning.
<P>
          An "article" is the unit of news, analogous to a MAIL  "message".
<P>
          A "poster" is a human being (or software equivalent) submitting a 
           possibly-compliant  article  to  be  "posted":  made
          available  for  reading  on  all relevant hosts.  A "posting
          agent" is software that assists posters to prepare articles,
          including  determining  whether the final article is compliant,
           passing it on to a  relayer  for  posting  if  so,  and
          returning  it  to  the poster with an explanation if not.  A
          "relayer" is  software  which  receives  allegedly-compliant
          articles  from  posting  agents and/or other relayers, files
          copies in a "news database", and possibly passes  copies  on
          to other relayers.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  While  the  same software may well function
   both as a relayer and as part of a posting  agent,
   the  two  functions are distinct and should not be
   confused.  The  posting  agent's  purpose  is  (in
   part) to validate an article, supply header information that can or should 
    be  supplied  automatically, and generally take reasonable actions in an
   attempt to transform the poster's submission  into
   a  compliant article.  The relayer's purpose is to
   move already-compliant articles around efficiently
   without damaging them.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          A "reader" is a human being reading news articles.  A 
          "reading agent" is software which presents articles to a  reader.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  Informal usage often uses "reader" for both
   these meanings, but this  introduces  considerable
   potential  for  confusion and misunderstanding, so
   this Draft takes care to make the distinction.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          A "newsgroup" is a single news  forum,  a  logical  bulletin
          board,  having a name and nominally intended for articles on
          a specific topic.  An article is "posted to" a single  newsgroup  
          or  several newsgroups.  When an article is posted to
          more than one newsgroup, it is said  to  be  "cross-posted";
          note that this differs from posting the same text as part of
          each of several articles, one per newsgroup.  A  "hierarchy"
          is  the set of all newsgroups whose names share a first component
           (see the name syntax in <A HREF = "#5.5"> section 5.5 </A>).
<P>
          A newsgroup may be "moderated", in  which  case  submissions
          are  not  posted  directly,  but mailed to a "moderator" for
          consideration and possible posting.   Moderators  are  typically 
           human but may be implemented partially or entirely in
          software.
<P>
          A "followup" is an article containing a response to the contents 
          of an earlier article (the followup's "precursor").  A
          "followup agent" is a combination of reading agent and posting 
          agent that aids in the preparation and posting of a followup.
<P>
          Text  comparisons  are  "case-sensitive"  if  they  consider
          uppercase  letters  (e.g. "A") different from lowercase letters 
          (e.g. "a"), and "case-insensitive" if letters differing
          only  in  case  (e.g. "A" and "a") are considered identical.
          Categories of text are said to be case-(in)sensitive if comparisons 
          of such texts to others are case-(in)sensitive.
<P>
          A  "cooperating  subnet"  is  a set of news-exchanging hosts
          which is sufficiently well-coordinated (typically via a central 
           administration of some sort) that stronger assumptions
          can be made about hosts in the set than about news hosts  in
          general.  This is typically used to relax restrictions which
          are otherwise required for worst-case interoperability;
           members  of  a cooperating subnet MAY interchange articles that
          do not conform to this Draft's specifications, provided  all
          members  have  agreed  to this and provided the articles are
          not permitted to leak out of the subnet.  The word  "subnet"
          is  used to emphasize that a cooperating subnet is typically
          not an isolated universe; care must be  taken  that  traffic
          leaving  the  subnet  complies  with the restrictions of the
          larger net, not just those of the cooperating subnet.
<P>
          A "message ID" is a unique identifier for an  article,  usually
           supplied by the posting agent which posted it.  It distinguishes 
           the article from every other article ever  posted
          anywhere (in theory).  Articles with the same message ID are
          treated as identical copies of the same article even if they
          are not in fact identical.
<P>
          A  "gateway"  is  software  which receives news articles and
          converts them to messages of some other kind (e.g. mail to a
          mailing list), or vice-versa; in essence it is a translating
          relayer that straddles boundaries between different  methods
          of  message  exchange.   The  most  common  type  of gateway
          connects newsgroup(s) to mailing list(s),  either  unidirectionally
            or  bidirectionally,  but  there are also gateways
          between news networks using this  Draft's  news  format  and
          those using other formats.
<P>
          A  "control  message"  is an article which is marked as containing 
          control information; a  relayer  receiving  such  an
          article  will  (subject  to  permissions  etc.) take actions
          beyond just filing and passing on the article.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> "Control article" would be  more  consistent
   terminology, but "control message" is already well
   established.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          An article's "reply address" is the address to which  mailed
          replies  should  be  sent.  This is the address specified in
          the article's From header (see <A HREF = "#5.2"> section 5.2 </A>),
           unless it  also
          has a Reply-To header (see <A HREF = "#6.3"> section 6.3 </A>).
<P>
          The  notation  (e.g.)  "(ASCII  17)"  following a name means
          "this name refers to the ASCII character having  value  17".
          An  "ASCII printable character" is an ASCII character in the
          range 33-126.  An "ASCII  control  character"  is  an  ASCII
          character  in  the  range  0-31, or the character DEL (ASCII
          127).  A "non-ASCII character" is a character having a value
          exceeding 127.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> Blank is neither an "ASCII printable character"
    nor an "ASCII control character".

          <H3><A NAME="2.4">2.4. End Of Line</A></H3>
<P>
          How the end of a text line is  represented  depends  on  the
          context  and  the implementation.  For Internet transmission
          via protocols such as SMTP [rrr], an  end-of-line  is  a  CR
          (ASCII  13)  followed  by an LF (ASCII 10).  ISO C [rrr] and
          many modern operating systems indicate  end-of-line  with  a
          single  character,  typically  ASCII LF (aka "newline"), and
          this is the normal convention when news is  transmitted  via
          UUCP.  A variety of other methods are in use, including outof-band
           methods in which there is no specific character that
          means end-of-line.
<P>
          This Draft does not constrain how end-of-line is represented
          in news, except that characters other than CR  and  LF  <B>MUST</B>
          not  be  usurped  for  use  in  end-of-line representations.
          Also, obviously, all software dealing with a particular copy
          of  an  article  must  agree  on  the convention to be used.
          "EOL" is used to mean "whatever  end-of-line  representation
          is  appropriate";  it  is  not  necessarily  a  character or
          sequence of characters.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> If faced with picking an EOL  representation
   in the absence of other constraints, use of a single character simplifies 
   processing, and the ASCII
   standard  [rrr] specifies that if one character is
   to be used for  this  purpose,  it  should  be  LF
   (ASCII 10).
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  Inside  MIME encodings, use of the Internet
   canonical EOL representation (CR followed  by  LF)
   is mandatory.  See [rrr].

   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> This is at  variance  with  MAIL,  which  is

<P>
          Various constant strings in this Draft, such as header names
          and  month  names,  are derived from English words.  Despite
          their derivation, these words do NOT change when the  poster
          or  reader employing them is interacting in a language other
          than English.  Posting and reading agents  <B>SHOULD</B>  translate
          
          as  appropriate  in  their  interaction  with  the poster or
          reader, but the forms that actually appear in  articles  are
          always the English-derived ones defined in this Draft.

          <H3><A NAME="3">3. Relation To MAIL

          RFC 822 </A> etc.)</A></H3>
<P>
          The  primary  intent of this Draft is to completely describe
          the news article format as a subset of MAIL's message format
          augmented by some new headers.  Unless explicitly noted otherwise, the intent throughout is that an article  <B>MUST</B>  also
          be a valid MAIL message.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  Despite  obvious  similarities between news
   and mail, opinions vary on whether it is  possible
   or  desirable to unify them into a single service.
   However, it is unquestionably  both  possible  and
   useful to employ some of the same tools for manipulating both mail messages and news  articles,  so
   there  is specific advantage to be had in defining
   them compatibly.  Furthermore, there is no  apparent need to re-invent the wheel when slight extensions to an existing definition will suffice.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Given that this Draft  attempts  to  be  self-contained,  it
          inevitably  contains  considerable repetition of information
          found in MAIL.  This raises the possibility of unintentional
          conflicts.  Unless specifically noted otherwise, any wording
          in this Draft which  permits  behavior  that  is  not  MAILcompliant  is  erroneous  and should be followed only to the
          extent that the result remains compliant with MAIL.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A> said "where this standard conflicts
   with  [<A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc0822.gz"> RFC 822 </A>], RFC-822 should be considered correct and this standard in  error".   Taken  literally, this was obviously incorrect, since <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A>
   imposed a number of restrictions not found in  <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc0822.gz"> RFC 822 </A>.
      The  intent,  however,  was  reasonable: to
   indicate  that  UNINTENTIONAL   differences   were
   errors in <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A>.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Implementors and users should note that MAIL is deliberately
          an extensible standard, and most extensions devised for mail
          are  also relevant to (and compatible with) news.  Note particularly MIME [rrr],  summarized  briefly  in  appendix  B,
          which extends MAIL in a number of useful ways that are definitely relevant to news.   Also  of  note  is  the  work  in
          progress  on  reconciling  PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail, which
          defines extensions for  authentication  and  security)  with
          MIME, after which this may also be relevant to news.

<P>
          Similarly, descriptions here of MIME  facilities  should  be
          considered  correct  only  to  the  extent  that they do not
          require or legitimize practices  that  would  violate  those
          RFCs.   (Note that this Draft does extend the application of
          some MIME facilities, but this is an extension  rather  than
          an alteration.)

          The overall syntax of a news article is:

<PRE>
   article         = 1*header separator body
   header          = start-line *continuation
   start-line      = header-name ":" space [ nonblank-text ] eol
   continuation    = space nonblank-text eol

   space           = 1*( &lt;HT (ASCII 9)&gt; / &lt;blank (ASCII 32)&gt; )
   space-or-text   = space / text-character
</PRE>
<P>
          An  article consists of some headers followed by a body.  An
          empty line separates the two.  The  headers  contain  structured information about the article and its transmission.  A
          header begins with a header name identifying it, and can  be
          continued  onto  subsequent lines by beginning the continuation line(s) with white space.   (Note  that  <A HREF = "#4.2.3"> section 4.2.3 </A>
          adds some restrictions to the header syntax indicated here.)
          The body is largely-unstructured text  significant  only  to
          the poster and the readers.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  Terminology here follows the current custom
   in the news community, rather than the  MAIL  convention  of  (sometimes) referring to what is here
   called a "header" as a "header field" or  "field".
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Note that the separator line must be truly empty, not just a
          line containing white space.  Further empty lines  following
          it  are  part  of the body, as are empty lines at the end of
          the article.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> Some systems  make  no  distinction  between
   empty lines and lines consisting entirely of white
   space;  indeed,  some  systems  cannot   represent
   entirely  empty  lines.  The grammar's requirement
   that header continuation lines contain some printable  text is meant to ensure that the empty/space
   distinction cannot confuse identification  of  the
   separator line.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  It  is tempting to authorize posting agents
   to strip empty lines at the beginning and  end  of
   the  body,  but such empty lines could possibly be
   part of a preformatted document.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Implementors are warned that trailing white  space,  whether
          alone  on  the  line or not, MAY be significant in the body,
          notably in early versions of  the  "uuencode"  encoding  for
          binary  data.  Trailing white space <B>MUST</B> be preserved unless
          the article is known to have originated within a cooperating
          subnet  that  avoids using significant trailing white space,
          and <B>SHOULD</B> be preserved regardless.   Posters  <B>SHOULD</B>  avoid
          using  conventions  or  encodings  which make trailing white
          space significant;  for  encoding  of  binary  data,  MIME's
          "base64"  encoding  is recommended.  Implementors are warned
          that ISO C implementations  are  not  required  to  preserve
          trailing  white space, and special precautions may be necessary in implementations which do not.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> Unfortunately, the signature-delimiter  convention (described in <A HREF = "#4.3.2"> section 4.3.2 </A>) does use significant trailing white space.  It's too  late  to
   fix  this;  there  is work underway on defining an
   organized signature convention as  part  of  MIME,
   which is a preferable solution in the long run.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Posters  are warned that some very old relayer software misbehaves when the first non-empty line  of  an  article  body
          begins with white space.

   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> MAIL header  names  can  contain  any  ASCII
   printable  character (other than colon) in theory,
   but in practice, arbitrary header names are  known
   to  cause trouble for some news software. <A HREF = "#4.1"> Section
   4.1's </A> restriction to alphanumeric sequences  separated by hyphens is believed to permit all widelyused header names without causing problems for any

   of  possibilities,  since aberrations are known to
   occur.

<P>
          Relayers <B>MUST</B> disregard headers not described in this  Draft

          and pass them on unaltered.
<P>
          Posters wishing to convey non-standard information in  headers  <B>SHOULD</B>  use header names beginning with "X-".  No standard header name will ever be of this form.  Reading  agents

          great care.
<P>
          The order of headers in an article is not significant.  However, posting agents are encouraged to put mandatory headers
          (see <A HREF = "#5"> section 5 </A>) first, followed  by  optional  headers  (see
          <A HREF = "#6"> section 6 </A>), followed by headers not defined in this Draft.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  While  relayers  and reading agents must be
   prepared to handle any order, having the  significant  headers (the precise definition of "significant" depends on  context)  first  can  noticeably
   improve  efficiency,  especially in memory-limited
   environments where it is difficult to buffer up an
   arbitrary  quantity of headers while searching for
   the few that matter.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Header names are case-insensitive.   There  is  a  preferred
          case  convention,  which  posters  and posting agents <B>SHOULD</B>
          use: each hyphen-separated "word" has its initial letter (if
          any)  in  uppercase  and  the rest in lowercase, except that
          some abbreviations have all letters  uppercase  (e.g.  "Message-ID"  and "MIME-Version").  The forms used in this Draft
          are the preferred forms for the  headers  described  herein.
          Relayers  and  reading agents are warned that articles might
          not obey this convention.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> Although software must be prepared  for  the
   possibility  of random use of case in header names
   (and other case-independent text), establishing  a

   the  preferred  forms  before  resorting  to lessefficient case-insensitive searches.

<P>
          In general, a header can consist of several lines, with each
          continuation line beginning with white space.  The EOLs preceding continuation lines are ignored when processing such a
          header, effectively combining the start-line and the continuations into a single logical line.  The logical line,  less
          the  header  name,  colon, and any white space following the
          colon, is the "header content".
<P>
<P>
          <H3><A NAME="4.2.2">4.2.2. Undesirable Headers</A></H3>
<P>
          A header whose content is empty  is  said  to  be  an  empty
          header.   Relayers  and  reading  agents <B>SHOULD</B> not consider
          presence or absence of an empty header to alter  the  semantics  of  an  article (although  syntactic  rules,  such as
          requirements that certain header names appear at  most  once
          in  an  article,  MUST  still be satisfied).   Posting  agents <B>SHOULD</B> delete empty
          headers from articles before posting them.
<P>
          Headers that merely state defaults explicitly (e.g., a  Followup-To  header  with  the  same  content as the Newsgroups
          header,  or  a  MIME  Content-Type  header   with   contents
          "text/plain;  charset=us-ascii")  or  state information that
          reading agents can  typically  determine  easily  themselves
          (e.g.  the length of the body in octets) are redundant, conveying no information whatsoever.  Headers that state information which cannot possibly be of use to a significant number of relayers, reading agents, or readers (e.g., the  name
          of  the software package used as the posting agent) are useless and pointless.  Posters and posting agents <B>SHOULD</B> avoid
          including redundant or useless headers in articles.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  Information  that someone, somewhere, might
   someday find useful is best omitted from  headers.
   (There's  quite  enough  of it in article bodies.)
   Headers should contain information of known  utility only.  This is not meant to preclude inclusion
   of information primarily meant  for  news-software
   debugging, but such information should be included
   only if there is real reason, preferably based  on
   experience,  to  suspect  that it may be genuinely
   useful.  Articles passing through gateways are the
   only  obvious  case  where  inclusion of debugging
   information appears clearly legitimate.  (See <A HREF = "#10.1"> section 10.1 </A>.)
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  A  useful rule of thumb for software implementors is: "if I had to pay a dollar  a  day  for
   the  transmission  of  this  header, would I still
   think it worthwhile?".

          <H3><A NAME="4.2.3">4.2.3. White Space and Continuations</A></H3>
<P>
          The colon following the header name on the  start-line  <B>MUST</B>
          be followed by white space, even if the header is empty.  If
          the header is not empty, at least some of the  content  <B>MUST</B>
          appear on the start-line.  Posting agents <B>MUST</B> enforce these
          restrictions, but relayers (etc.) <B>SHOULD</B> accept  even  articles that violate them.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  MAIL does not require white space after the
   colon, but it is usual.   <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A>  required  the
   white  space,  even  in  empty  headers,  and some
   existing  software  demands  it.   In  MAIL,   and
   arguably  in  <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A>  (although  the wording is
   vague), it is technically legitimate for the white
   space  to  be  part  of a continuation line rather
   than the start-line, but not all existing software
   will  accept  this.   Deleting  empty  headers and
   placing some content on the start-line avoids this
   issue...   which  is  desirable  because  trailing
   blanks, easily deleted by accident, are  best  not
   made significant in headers.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          In  general,  posters  and  posting  agents <B>SHOULD</B> use blank
          (ASCII 32), not tab (ASCII 9), where white space is  desired
          in  headers.  Existing software does not consistently accept
          tab as synonymous with blank in all contexts.   In  particular, <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A> appeared to specify that the character immediately following the colon after a header name  was  required
          to  be  a  blank, and some news software insists on that, so
          this character <B>MUST</B> be a blank.  Again, posting agents  <B>MUST</B>
          enforce  these restrictions but relayers <B>SHOULD</B> be more tolerant.
<P>
          Since the white space beginning a continuation line  remains
          a  part  of  the  logical line, headers can be "broken" into
          multiple lines only at white space.  Posting  agents  <B>SHOULD</B>
          not  break  headers unnecessarily.  Relayers <B>SHOULD</B> preserve
          existing header breaks, and <B>SHOULD</B> not introduce new breaks.
          Breaking headers <B>SHOULD</B> be a last resort; relayers and reading agents <B>SHOULD</B> handle long header lines gracefully.  (See
          the discussion of size limits in <A HREF = "#4.6"> section 4.6 </A>.)

          Although  the  article  body is unstructured for most of the

<P>
          <H3><A NAME="4.3.1">4.3.1. Body Format Issues</A></H3>
<P>
          The body of an article MAY be empty, although posting agents
          <B>SHOULD</B> consider this an error condition (meriting  returning
          the  article  to  the poster for revision).  A posting agent
          which does not reject such an article <B>SHOULD</B> issue a warning
          message  to  the  poster  and supply a non-empty body.  Note
          that the separator line <B>MUST</B> be present even if the body  is
          empty.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  An  empty  body  is probably a poster error
   except, arguably, for some control messages... and
   even  they  really ought to have a body explaining
   the reason for  the  control  message.   Some  old
   reading  agents are known to generate empty bodies
   for "cancel" control messages, so  posting  agents
   might opt not to reject body-less articles in such
   cases (although it would  be  better  to  fix  the
   reading  agents to request a body).  However, some
   existing news software is known to react badly  to
   body-less  articles, hence the request for posting
   agents to insert a body in such cases.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> A possible posting-agent-supplied body  text
   (already  used by one widespread posting agent) is
   "This article was probably generated  by  a  buggy
   news  reader.".   (The use of "reader" to refer to
   the reading agent is  traditional,  although  this
   Draft uses more precise terminology.)
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  The requirement for the separator line even
   in a bodyless article is inherited from MAIL,  and
   also  distinguishes legitimately-bodyless articles
   from articles accidentally truncated in the middle
   of the headers.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Note  that an article body is a sequence of lines terminated
          by EOLs, not arbitrary binary data,  and  in  particular  it
          <B>MUST</B>  end  with  an EOL.  However, relayers <B>SHOULD</B> treat the
          body of an article as an uninterpreted  sequence  of  octets
          (except  as mandated by changes of EOL representation and by
          control-message processing) and <B>SHOULD</B> avoid  imposing  constraints on it.  See also <A HREF = "#4.6"> section 4.6 </A>.

<P>
          Although  body lines can in principle be very long (see <A HREF = "#4.6"> section 4.6 </A> for some  discussion  of  length  limits),  posters
          <B>SHOULD</B> restrict body line lengths to circa 70-75 characters.
          On systems where text is  conventionally  stored  with  EOLs
          only  at  paragraph  breaks  and other "hard return" points,
          with software breaking lines as appropriate for  display  or
          manipulation, posting agents <B>SHOULD</B> insert EOLs as necessary
          so that posted articles comply with this restriction.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> News originated in environments  where  line
   breaks  in  plain  text files were supplied by the
   user, not the software.  Be this good or bad, much
   reading-agent  and  posting-agent software assumes
   that news articles follow this convention,  so  it
   is  often inconvenient to read or respond to articles which violate it.  The "70-75"  number  comes
   from  the  widespread use of display devices which
   are 80 columns wide, and the desire to leave a bit
   of margin for quoting etc. (see below).
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Reading  agents  confronted with body lines much longer than
          the available output-device  width  <B>SHOULD</B>  break  lines  as
          appropriate.   Posters  are  warned that such breaks may not
          occur exactly where the poster intends.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> "As  appropriate"  would  typically  include
   breaking lines when supplying the text of an article to be quoted in a reply or followup, something
   that line-breaking reading agents often neglect to
   do now.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Although styles vary widely, for plain text it is  usual  to
          use  no  left  margin,  leave  the  right edge ragged, use a
          single empty line to separate paragraphs, and employ  normal
          natural-language  usage  on matters such as upper/lowercase.
          (In particular, articles <B>SHOULD</B> not be written  entirely  in
          uppercase.   In  environments where posters have access only
          to uppercase, posting agents <B>SHOULD</B> translate it  to  lowercase.)
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  Most people find substantial bodies of text
   entirely in uppercase  relatively  hard  to  read,
   while  all-lowercase  text  merely  looks slightly
   odd.  The common  association  of  uppercase  with
   strong emphasis adds to this.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Tone  of voice does not carry well in written text, and misunderstandings are common when sarcasm, parody, or exaggeration for humorous effect is attempted without explicit warning.  It has become conventional to use the sequence  ":-)",
          which  (on  most output devices) resembles a rotated <A HREF="http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/outerspace/netnews/smilies.html">"smiley
          face"</A> symbol, as a marker for text not  meant  to  be  taken
          literally, especially when humor is intended.  This practice
          aids communication and averts unintended  ill-will;  posters
          are  urged  to use it.  A variety of analogous sequences are
          used with less-standardized meanings <A HREF="#sanderson">[Sanderson]</A>.
<P>
          The order of arrival of news articles at a  particular  host
          depends  somewhat  on  transmission  paths, and occasionally
          articles are lost for various reasons.  When responding to a
          previous article, posters <B>SHOULD</B> not assume that all readers
          understand the exact context.  It is common to quote some of
          the  previous  article to establish context.  This <B>SHOULD</B> be
          done by prefacing each quoted line (even  if  it  is  empty)
          with the character "&gt;".  This will result in multiple levels
          of "&gt;" when quoted context itself contains quoted context.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> It may seem superfluous to put a  prefix  on
   empty  lines,  but it simplifies implementation of
   functions such as "skip all quoted text" in  reading agents.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Readability is enhanced if quoted text and new text are separated by an empty line.
<P>
          Posters <B>SHOULD</B> edit quoted context to trim it  down  to  the
          minimum  necessary.   However,  posting  agents  <B>SHOULD</B>  not
          attempt to enforce this by imposing overly-simplistic  rules
          like "no more than 50% of the lines should be quotes".
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> While encouraging trimming is desirable, the
   50% rule imposed by some  old  posting  agents  is
   both inadequate and counterproductive.  Posters do
   not respond to it by being  more  selective  about
   quoting;  they respond by padding short responses,
   or by using different  quoting  styles  to  defeat
   automatic  analysis.   The former adds unnecessary
   noise and volume, while the  latter  also  defeats
   more useful forms of automatic analysis that reading agents might wish to do.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> At the very  least,  if  a  minimum-unquoted
   quota  is  being  set, article bodies shorter than
   (say) 20 lines, or perhaps articles  which  exceed
   the  quota  by only a few lines, should be exempt.
   This avoids the ridiculous situation of  complaining about a 5-line response to a 6-line quote.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  A more subtle posting-agent rule, suggested
   for experimental use, is to reject  articles  that
   appear  to  contain quoted signatures (see below).
   This is almost certainly the result of a  careless
   poster  not bothering to trim down quoted context.
   Also, if a posting agent or  followup  agent  presents  an article template to the poster for editing, it really should take  note  of  whether  the
   poster actually made any changes, and refrain from
   posting an unmodified template.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Some followup agents supply "attribution" lines  for  quoted
          context,  indicating where it first appeared and under whose
          name.  When multiple  levels  of  quoting  are  present  and
          quoted  context  is  edited for brevity, "inner" attribution
          lines are not always retained.  The editing process is  also
          somewhat  error-prone.   Reading  agents  (and  readers) are
          warned not to assume that attributions are accurate.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>UNRESOLVED ISSUE:</B> Should  a  standard  format  for
   attribution  lines  be  defined?  There is already
   considerable diversity... but automatic news analysis  would  be  substantially aided by a standard
   convention.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Early difficulties in inferring return addresses from  article  headers led to "signatures": short closing texts, automatically added to the end of articles  by  posting  agents,
          identifying the poster and giving his network addresses etc.
          If a poster or posting agent does append a signature  to  an
          article,  the  signature <B>SHOULD</B> be preceded with a delimiter
          line containing (only) two hyphens (ASCII  45)  followed  by
          one  blank  (ASCII  32).   Posting  agents  <B>SHOULD</B> limit the
          length of signatures,  since  verbose  excess  bordering  on
          abuse  is  common  if  no restraint is imposed; 4 lines is a
          common limit.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> While signatures  are  arguably  a  blemish,
   they are a well-understood convention, and conveying the same information in headers exposes it  to
   mangling  and makes it rather less conspicuous.  A
   standard delimiter  line  makes  it  possible  for
   reading  agents  to handle signatures specially if
   desired.  (This  is  unfortunately  hampered  by
               extensive misunderstanding of, and misuse of,  the
               delimiter.)
   <P><B>NOTE:</B> The  choice  of  delimiter  is  somewhat
   unfortunate,  since  it  relies on preservation of
   trailing  white  space,  but  it  is   too   wellestablished  to change.  There is work underway to
   define a more sophisticated  signature  scheme  as
   part  of  MIME, and this will presumably supersede
   the current convention in due time.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> Four 75-column lines of  signature  text  is
   300  characters, which is ample to convey name and
   mail-address  information  in  all  but  the  most
   bizarre situations.

          except for tab (ASCII 9), formfeed (ASCII 12), and backspace
          (ASCII  8).  Tab signifies sufficient horizontal white space
          to reach the next of a set of fixed positions;  posters  are
          warned  that  there is no standard set of positions, so tabs
          should be avoided if precise spacing is essential.  Formfeed
          signifies  a point at which a reading agent <B>SHOULD</B> pause and
          await  reader  interaction  before displaying further text .    Backspace
          <B>SHOULD</B>  be  used only for underlining, done by a sequence of
          underscores (ASCII 95)  followed  by  an  equal  number  of
          backspaces,  signifying that the same number of text characters following are to be  underlined.   Posters  are  warned
          that  underlining is not available on all output devices and
          is best not relied on for essential meaning.  Reading agents
          <B>SHOULD</B>  recognize underlining and translate it to the appropriate commands for devices that support it.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> Interpretation of almost all control characters   is  device-specific  to  some  degree,  and
   devices differ.  Tabs  and  underlining  are  supported, to some extent, by most modern devices and
   reading agents, hence the cautious exemptions  for
   them.  The underlining method is specified because
   the inverse method, text and then underscores,  is
   tempting  to the naive... but if sent unaltered to
   a device that shows only the most recent  of  several  overstruck  characters rather than a composite, the result can be utterly unreadable.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> A common interpretation of tab is that it is
   a  request  to  space forward to the next position
   whose number is one more than  a  multiple  of  8,
   with  positions  numbered sequentially starting at
   1.  (So tab positions are 9, 17, 25, ...)  Reading
   agents  not constrained by existing system conventions might wish to use this interpretation.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> It will typically be necessary for a reading
   agent  to  catch  and interpret formfeed, not just
   send it to the output device.   The  actions  performed  by  typical  output devices on receiving a
   formfeed are neither adequate for nor  appropriate
   to the pause-for-interaction meaning.

   <B>NOTE:</B> There are now  standard  Internet  encodings
   for Japanese [rrr] and Vietnamese [rrr] in particular.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Articles <B>MUST</B> not contain any  octet  with  value  exceeding
          127, i.e. any octet that is not an ASCII character.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  This  rule,  like others, may be relaxed by
   unanimous consent of the members of a  cooperating
   subnet, provided suitable precautions are taken to
   ensure that rule-violating articles  do  not  leak
   out of the subnet.  (This has already been done in
   many areas where ASCII is  not  adequate  for  the
   local language(s).)  Beware that articles containing non-ASCII octets in headers are a violation of
   the  MAIL  specifications  and  are not valid MAIL
   messages.  MIME offers a way to  encode  non-ASCII
   characters  in  ASCII for use in headers; see <A HREF = "#4.5"> section 4.5 </A>.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> While there is great interest in using 8-bit
   character  sets,  not  all software can yet handle
   them correctly.  Hence the restriction to  cooperating  subnets.   MIME  encodings  can  be used to
   transmit such characters  while  remaining  within
   the octet restriction.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          In  anticipation  of the day when it is possible to use nonASCII characters safely anywhere, and  to  provide  for  the
          (substantial)  cooperating  subnets  that  are already using
          them, transmission paths <B>SHOULD</B> treat news articles as uninterpreted  sequences of octets (except perhaps for transformations between EOL  representations)  and  relayers  <B>SHOULD</B>
          treat  non-ASCII  characters in articles as ordinary characters.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> 8-bit enthusiasts are warned  that  not  all
   software  conforms  to  these recommendations yet.
   In particular, standard NNTP [rrr] is a 7-bit protocol,  and  there  may  be  implementations which
   enforce this rule.  Be warned, also, that it  will
   never  be safe to send raw binary data in the body
   of news articles, because changes of EOL representation may (will!) corrupt it.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Except   where   cooperating   subnets  permit  more  direct
          approaches, MIME [rrr] headers and encodings <B>SHOULD</B> be  used
          to  transmit  non-ASCII  content using ASCII characters; see
          <A HREF = "#4.5"> section 4.5 </A>, appendix B, and the MIME RFCs for details.   If
          article  content  can  be  expressed in ASCII, it <B>SHOULD</B> be.
          Failing that, the order of preference for character sets  is
          that described in MIME [rrr].
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> Using the MIME facilities, it is possible to
   transmit ANY character set, and ANY form of binary
   data, using only ASCII characters.  Equally important, such articles are  self-describing  and  the
   reading  agent can tell which octet-to-symbol mapping is intended!  Designation of  some  preferred
   character  sets is intended to minimize the number
   of character sets that a reading agent must understand  in order to display most articles properly.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Articles containing  non-ASCII  characters,  articles  using
          ASCII  characters  (values  0  through 127) to refer to nonASCII symbols, and articles using escape sequences to  shift
          character  sets <B>SHOULD</B> include MIME headers indicating which
          character set(s) and conventions are being used, and <B>MUST</B> do
          so unless such articles are strictly confined to a cooperating subnet which has its own pre-agreed  conventions.   MIME
          encodings  are  preferred  over all these techniques.  If it
          comes to a relayer's attention that it  is  being  asked  to
          pass an article using such techniques outward across what it
          knows to be the boundary of such a  cooperating  subnet,  it
          <B>MUST</B>  report this error to its administrator, and MAY refuse
          to pass the article beyond the subnet boundary.  If it  does
          pass  the  article, it <B>MUST</B> re-encode it with MIME encodings
          to make it conform to this Draft.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> Such re-encoding is a non-trivial task,  due
   to  MIME  rules  such as the prohibition of nested
   encodings.  It's not just a matter of pouring  the
   body through a simple filter.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Reading  agents <B>SHOULD</B> note MIME headers and attempt to show
          the  reader  the  closest  possible  approximation  to   the
          intended  content.   They <B>SHOULD</B> not just send the octets of
          the article to the output device unaltered, unless there  is
          reason  to believe that the output device will indeed interpret them correctly.  Reading agents  <B>MUST</B>  not  pass  ASCII
          control  characters  or escape sequences, other than as discussed above, unaltered to the output device; only by chance
          would  the  result  be the desired one, and there is serious
          potential for harmful side  effects,  either  accidental  or
          malicious.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  Exactly  what  to  do with unwanted control
   characters/sequences depends on the philosophy  of
   the  reading  agent,  but passing them straight to
   the output device is almost always wrong.  If  the
   reading agent wants to mark the presence of such a
   character/sequence  in  circumstances  where  only
   ASCII  printable  characters are available, translating it to "#" might be a suitable  method;  "#"
   is  a  conspicuous character seldom used in normal
   text.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> Reading agents should be aware that many old
   output devices (or the transmission paths to them)
   zero out the top bit of octets sent to them.  This
   can transform non-ASCII characters into ASCII control characters.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Followup agents <B>MUST</B> be careful to apply appropriate  transformations  of  representation  to  the outbound followup as
          well as the inbound precursor.  A  followup  to  an  article
          containing non-ASCII material is very likely to contain nonASCII material itself.
<P>
<P>
          <H3><A NAME="4.5">4.5. Non-ASCII Characters In Headers</A></H3>
<P>
          All octets found in headers <B>MUST</B> be ASCII characters.   However,  it  is  desirable to have a way of encoding non-ASCII
          characters, especially in "human-readable" headers  such  as
          Subject.   MIME  [rrr]  provides  a  way  to  do this.  Full
          details may be found in the MIME specifications; herewith  a
          quick summary to alert software authors to the issues...
<P>
<PRE>
   encoded-word  = "=?" charset "?" encoding "?" codes "?="
   charset       = 1*tag-char
   encoding      = 1*tag-char
   tag-char      = &lt;ASCII printable character except !()&lt;&gt;@,;:\"[]/?=&gt;
   codes         = 1*code-char
   code-char     = &lt;ASCII printable character except ?&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
          An  encoded word is a sequence of ASCII printable characters
          that specifies the character set, encoding method, and  bits
          of  (potentially)  non-ASCII  characters.  Encoded words are
          allowed only in certain positions in certain headers.   Specific  headers impose restrictions on the content of encoded
          words beyond that specified in this  section .  Posting agents
          <B>MUST</B>  ensure  that  any  material resembling an encoded word
          (complete with all delimiters), in a context  where  encoded
          words may appear, really is an encoded word.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  The  syntax  is  a  bit  ugly,  but  it was
   designed to minimize  chances  of  confusion  with
   legitimate  header contents, and to satisfy difficult constraints on use within existing headers.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          An encoded word <B>MUST</B> not be more than 75 octets long.   Each
          line  of a header containing encoded word(s) <B>MUST</B> be at most
          76 octets long, not counting the EOL.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> These limits are meant to bound  the  lookahead  needed to determine whether text that begins
   "=?" is really an encoded word.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          The details of charsets and encodings are  defined  by  MIME
          [rrr];  the sequence of preferred character sets is the same
          as MIME's.  Encoded words <B>SHOULD</B> not  be  used  for  content
          expressible in ASCII.
<P>
          When an encoded word is used, other than in a newsgroup name
          (see <A HREF = "#5.5"> section 5.5 </A>), it <B>MUST</B> be separated  from  any  adjacent
          non-space  characters  (including  other  encoded  words) by
          white space.  Reading  agents  displaying  the  contents  of
          encoded  words  (as  opposed  to  their encoded form) should
          ignore white space adjacent to encoded words.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>UNRESOLVED ISSUE:</B> Should this  section  be  deleted
   entirely,  or  made much more terse?  The material
   is relevant, but too complex to discuss fully.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> The deletion of intervening white space permits using multiple encoded words, implicitly concatenated by the deletion,  to  encode  text  that
   will  not fit within a single 75-character encoded
   word.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Reading-agent implementors are  warned  that  although  this
          Draft completely specifies where encoded words may appear in
          the headers it defines, there are other  headers  (e.g.  the
          MIME Content-Description header) that MAY contain them.
<P>
<P>
          <H3><A NAME="4.6">4.6. Size Limits</A></H3>
<P>
          Implementations  <B>SHOULD</B> avoid fixed constraints on the sizes
          of lines within an article and on the  size  of  the  entire
          article.
<P>
          Relayers  <B>SHOULD</B> treat the body of an article as an uninterpreted sequence of octets (except as mandated by changes  of
          EOL  representation and processing of control messages), not
          to be altered or constrained in any way.
<P>
          If it is  absolutely  necessary  for  an  implementation  to
          impose a limit on the length of header lines, body lines, or
          header logical lines, that limit  shall  be  at  least  1000
          octets,  including EOL representations.  Relayers and transmission paths confronted with lines  beyond  their  internal
          limits  (if  any)  <B>MUST</B>  not  simply  inject  EOLs at random
          places; they MAY break headers (as described in <A HREF="#4.2.3">4.2.3</A>) as  a
          last  resort,  and  otherwise they <B>MUST</B> either pass the long
          lines through unaltered, or refuse to pass  the  article  at
          all (see <A HREF = "#9.1"> section 9.1 </A> for further discussion).
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> The limit here is essentially the same minimum as that specified for SMTP  mail  in  <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc0821.gz"> RFC 821 </A>
   [rrr].   Implementors  are  warned  that Path (see
   <A HREF = "#5.6"> section 5.6 </A>)  and  References  (see  <A HREF = "#6.5"> section 6.5 </A>)
   headers,  in particular, often become several hundred characters long, so 1000  is  not  an  overly
   generous limit.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          All  implementations  <B>MUST</B>  be  able  to  handle  an article
          totalling at least 65,000 octets, including headers and  EOL
          representations,  gracefully and efficiently.  All implementations <B>SHOULD</B> be able to handle  an  article  totalling  at
          least  1,000,000 (one million) octets, including headers and
          EOL representations, gracefully  and  efficiently.   "Gracefully  and  efficiently"  is  intended  to preclude not only
          failures, but also major loss of performance, serious  problems  in error recovery, or resource consumption beyond what
          is reasonably necessary.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> The intent here is to prohibit lowering  the
   existing   de-facto   limit   any  further,  while
   strongly encouraging  movement  towards  a  higher
   one.   Actually,  although improvements are desirable in some cases, much news software copes  reasonably  well  with very large articles.  The same
   cannot be said of the communications software  and
   protocols  used  to transmit news from one host to
   another, especially when slow communications links
   are   involved.   Occasional  huge  articles  that
   appear now (by accident or through ignorance) typically  leave  trails  of failing software, system
   problems, and irate administrators in their  wake.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  It  is  intended that the successor to this
   Draft will raise the "<B>MUST</B>" limit to 1,000,000 and
   the "<B>SHOULD</B>" limit still further.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Posters  <B>SHOULD</B>  limit  posted  articles  to  at most 60,000
          octets, including headers and  EOL  representations,  unless
          the articles are being posted only within a cooperating subnet which is known to be capable of handling larger articles
          gracefully.   Posting  agents presented with a large article
          <B>SHOULD</B> warn the poster and request confirmation.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> The difference between this and the  earlier
   "<B>MUST</B>"  limit is margin for header growth, differing EOL representations,  and  transmission  overheads.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  Disagreeable though these limits are, it is
   a fact that in current networks, an article larger
   than  64K (after header growth etc.) simply is not
   transmitted  reliably.   Note  also  the  comments
   above  on  the  trauma caused by single extremelylarge articles now; the problems are real and current.   These  problems  arguably should be fixed,
   but this will not happen network-wide in the immediate  future.   Hence  the  restriction of larger
   articles to cooperating subnets, for now.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Posters using non-ASCII characters in their text  <B>MUST</B>  take
          into  account the overhead involved in MIME encoding, unless
          the article's propagation will  be  entirely  limited  to  a
          cooperating  subnet  which  does  not use MIME encodings for
          non-ASCII characters.  For  example,  MIME  base64  encoding
          involves  growth  by  a  factor  of approximately 4/3, so an
          article which would likely have to use this encoding  should
          be at most about 45,000 octets before encoding.
<P>
          Posters  <B>SHOULD</B>  use  MIME  "message/partial" conventions to
          facilitate automatic reassembly of a  large  document  split
          into smaller pieces for posting.  It is recommended that the
          content identifier used should be a message ID, generated by
          the same means as article message IDs (see <A HREF = "#5.3"> section 5.3 </A>), and
          that all parts should have a See-Also  header  (see  <A HREF = "#6.16"> section 
          6.16</A>)  giving the message IDs of at least the previous parts
          and preferably all the parts.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> See-Also is more correct  for  this  purpose
   than  References, although References is in common
   use today (with  less-formal  reassembly  arrangements).  MIME reassemblers should probably examine
   articles suggested by References headers  if  SeeAlso  headers  are  not  present  to  indicate the
   whereabouts  of   the   other   parts   of   "message/partial" articles.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          To repeat: implementations <B>SHOULD</B> avoid fixed constraints on
          the sizes of lines within an article and on the size of  the
          entire article.

<P>
          An  article <B>MUST</B> have one, and only one, of each of the following headers: Date, From, Message-ID, Subject, Newsgroups,
          Path.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> MAIL specifies (if read most carefully) that
   there must be exactly one Date header and  exactly
   one  From  header, but otherwise does not restrict
   multiple appearances  of  headers.   (Notably,  it
   permits   multiple   Message-ID   headers!)   This
   appears singularly useless, or  even  harmful,  in
   the  context  of news, and much current news software will not  tolerate  multiple  appearances  of
   mandatory headers.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Note  also that there are situations, discussed in the relevant parts  of  <A HREF = "#6"> section 6 </A>,  where  References,  Sender,  or
          Approved headers are mandatory.
<P>
          In the discussions of the individual headers, the content of
          each is specified using the syntax notation.  The convention
          used is that the content of, for example, the Subject header
          is defined as &lt;Subject-content&gt;.

   weekday       = "Mon" / "Tue" / "Wed" / "Thu"

</PRE>
<P>
          This is a restricted subset of the MAIL date format.
<P>
          If  a weekday is given, it <B>MUST</B> be consistent with the date.
          The modern Gregorian calendar is used,  and  dates  <B>MUST</B>  be
          consistent  with  its usual conventions; for example, if the
          month is May, the day must be between 1  and  31  inclusive.
          The  year <B>SHOULD</B> be given as four digits, and posting agents
          <B>SHOULD</B> enforce this; however, relayers <B>MUST</B> accept the  twodigit  form,  and  <B>MUST</B>  interpret it as having the implicit

<P>
          The  time  is  given  on  the  24-hour clock, e.g. two hours
          before midnight is "22:00" or "22:00:00".  The  hh  must  be
          between  00 and 23 inclusive, the mm between 0 and 59 inclusive, and the ss between 0 and 61 inclusive.

<P>
          The  date  and  time  <B>SHOULD</B>  be given in the poster's local
          timezone, including a specification of that  timezone  as  a
          numeric offset (which <B>SHOULD</B> include the timezone name, e.g.
          "EST", supplied in parentheses like  a  MAIL  comment).   If
          not, they <B>MUST</B> be given in Universal Time (abbreviated "UT";
          "GMT" is a historical synonym for "UT").  The timezone  name
          in  parentheses,  if  present,  is  a comment; software <B>MUST</B>
          ignore it, except that reading agents might wish to  display
          it  to the reader.  Timezone names other than "UT" and "GMT"
          <B>MUST</B> appear only in the comment.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> Attempts to deal with a full set of timezone
   names  have  all  foundered  on the vast number of
   such names in use and the duplications (for  example,  there  are at
   least FIVE different timezones
   called "EST" by somebody).  Even the  limited  set
   of North American zone names authorized by MAIL is
   subject to confusion and misinterpretation.  Hence
   the  flat  ban  on non-UT timezone names except as
   comments.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A> specified that use of GMT (aka  UT,
   UTC)  was  preferred.  However, the local time (in
   the poster's timezone) is arguably information  of
   possible interest to the reader, and this requires
   some indication of the poster's timezone.  Numeric
   offsets  are an unambiguous way of doing this, and
   their use was indeed sanctioned by <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A>  (that
   is, this is a change of preference only).
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>   There  is  frequent  confusion,  including
   errors in some news software, regarding  the  sign
   of  numeric  timezones.   Zones  west of Greenwich
   have negative offsets.  For example, North  American  Eastern Standard Time is zone -0500 and North

   <B>NOTE:</B> Implementors are warned that  the  hh  in  a
   timezone  can go up to about 14; it is not limited

   always as defined in this Draft, regardless of the
   language   used   to  interact  with  readers  and
   posters.  Reading and posting agents should translate  as  appropriate.   Actually,  even  Englishlanguage reading and posting agents will  probably
   want to do some degree of translation on dates, if
   only to abbreviate the lengthy  format  and  (perhaps) translate to and from the reader's timezone.

          The From header contains the electronic address, and  possibly the full name, of the article's author:
<P>
<PRE>
   From-content  = address [ space "(" paren-phrase ")" ]
                 /  [ plain-phrase space ] "&lt;" address "&gt;"

</PRE>
<P>
          (Encoded words are described in <A HREF = "#4.5"> section 4.5 </A>.)  The full name
          is distinguished  from  the  electronic  address  either  by
          enclosing  the  former  in parentheses (making it resemble a
          MAIL comment, after the address) or by enclosing the  latter
          in  angle  brackets.   The second form is preferred.  In the
          first form, encoded words inside the full name <B>MUST</B> be  composed  entirely  of  &lt;paren-char&gt;s.   In  the  second  form,
          encoded words inside the full name may not  contain  characters  other  than  letters (of either case), digits, and the
          characters "!", "*", "+", "-", "/", "=", and "_".  The local
          part is case-sensitive (except that all case counterparts of
          "postmaster" are deemed equivalent),  the  domain  is  caseinsensitive,  and  all  other  parts of the From content are
          comments which <B>MUST</B> be  ignored  by  news  software  (except
          insofar  as  reading  agents may wish to display them to the
          reader).  Posters and posting  agents  <B>MUST</B>  restrict  themselves  to this subset of the MAIL From syntax; relayers MAY
          accept a broader subset, but see the discussion  in  <A HREF = "#9.1"> section 9.1 </A>.
          
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  The  syntax  here is a restricted subset of
   the MAIL From syntax,  with  quoting  particularly
   restricted,  for  simple  parsing.  In particular,
   the presence of "&lt;" in the From content  indicates
   that  the second form is being used, otherwise the
   first form is being used.  The major  restrictions
   here  are those already de-facto imposed by existing software.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> Overly-lenient posting agents sometimes permit  the  second  form with a full name containing
   "(" or ")", but it is extremely rare  for  a  full
   name  to contain "&lt;" or "&gt;" even in mail.  Accordingly, reading agents wishing to  robustly  determine  which form is in use in a particular article
   should key on the presence or absence of "&lt;",  not
   the presence or absence of "(".

          The pseudo-domain ".uucp" MAY be used for  hosts  registered

   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  "Other forms" specifically include UK-style

<P>
          If  it is necessary to use the local part to specify a routing relative to the nearest Internet host, this <B>MUST</B> be done
          using the "% hack", using "%" as a secondary "@".  For example, to specify that mail to the address should go to Internet  host  "foo.bar.edu",  then  to non-Internet host "ein",
          then to non-Internet host  "deux",  for  delivery  there  to
          mailbox "fred", a suitable address would be:
<P>
<DL><DD><TT>

</TT></DD></DL>
<P>
          Analogous  forms  using  "!"  in  the local part <B>MUST</B> not be

<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> "a!b@c" can be interpreted as either "b%c@a"
   or "b%a@c", and there is no consistency  in  which
   choice  is  made.  Such addresses consequently are
   unreliable.  The "%" form  does  not  suffer  from
   this  problem,  and although its use is officially
   discouraged, it is a  de-facto  standard,  to  the
   point that MAIL recognizes it.

          Trying  to  "fix"  a  non-conforming address has a very high

          unchanged, or reject the article.

          <H3><A NAME="5.3">5.3. Message-ID</A></H3>
<P>
          The Message-ID header contains the article's message ID,  a  unique  identifier  distinguishing the article from
          every other article:
<P>
<PRE>
   Message-ID-content  = message-id
   message-id          = "&lt;" local-part "@" domain "&gt;"
</PRE>
<P>
          As with From addresses, a message ID's local part  is  casesensitive  and  its domain is case-insensitive.  The "&lt;" and
          "&gt;" are parts of the message ID, not  peculiarities  of  the
          Message-ID header.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  News message IDs are a restricted subset of
   MAIL message IDs.  In particular, no existing news
   software  copes properly with MAIL quoting conventions within the local part, so they  are  forbidden.   This is unfortunate, particularly for X.400
   gateways that often  wish  to  include  characters
   which  are  not legal in unquoted message IDs, but
   it is impossible to fix net-wide.  See  the  notes
   on gatewaying in <A HREF = "#10"> section 10 </A>.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          The  domain  in  the  message ID <B>SHOULD</B> be the full Internet
          domain name of the posting agent's host.  Use of the ".uucp"
          pseudo-domain (for hosts registered in the UUCP maps) or the
          ".bitnet" pseudo-domain (for Bitnet hosts)  is  permissible,
          but <B>SHOULD</B> be avoided.
<P>
          Posters and posting agents <B>MUST</B> generate the local part of a
          message ID using an algorithm which obeys the specified syntax  (words  separated  by  ".", with certain characters not
          permitted) (see <A HREF = "#5.2"> section 5.2 </A>  for  details),  and  will  not
          repeat  itself  (ever).   The  algorithm <B>SHOULD</B> not generate
          message IDs which differ only in case of letters.  Note  the
          specification in <A HREF = "#6.5"> section 6.5 </A> of a recommended convention for
          indicating subject changes.  Otherwise the algorithm  is  up
          to the implementor.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> The crucial use of message IDs is to distinguish circulating articles  from  each  other  and
   from  articles circulated recently.  They are also
   potentially useful  as  permanent  indexing  keys,
   hence  the requirement for permanent uniqueness...
   but  indexers  cannot  absolutely  rely  on   this
   because  the  earlier  RFCs  urged  it but did not
   demand it.  All major implementations have  always
   generated   permanently-unique   message   IDs  by
   design, but in some cases  this  is  sensitive  to
   proper  administration,  and  duplicates  may have
   occurred by accident.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> The most popular method of generating  local
   parts  is  to use the date and time, plus some way
   of distinguishing between simultaneous postings on
   the  same host (e.g. a process number), and encode
   them in a suitably-restricted alphabet.  An  older
   but  now  less-popular  alternative  is  to  use a
   sequence number, incremented each  time  the  host
   generates  a new message ID; this is workable, but
   requires careful  design  to  cope  properly  with
   simultaneous  posting  attempts,  and  is  not  as
   robust in the presence of crashes and  other  malfunctions.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  Some  buggy news software considers message
   IDs completely case-insensitive, hence the  advice
   to   avoid  relying  on  case  distinctions.   The
   restrictions placed on  the  "alphabet"  of  local
   parts  and  domains in <A HREF = "#5.2"> section 5.2 </A> have the useful
   side effect of making it unnecessary to parse message  IDs in complex ways to break them into casesensitive and case-insensitive portions.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          The local part of a message ID <B>MUST</B> not be  "postmaster"  or
          any other string that would compare equal to "postmaster" in
          a case-insensitive  comparison.   Message  IDs  <B>MUST</B>  be  no
          longer than 250 octets, including the "&lt;" and "&gt;".
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  "Postmaster"  is  an  irksome  exception to
   case-sensitivity in local  parts,  inherited  from
   MAIL,  and  simply  avoiding it is the best way to
   deal with it (not that it's likely, but the  issue
   needs  to  be  dealt  with).   The length limit is
   undesirable, but is present in widely-used  existing  software.   The  limit is actually 255, but a
   small safety margin is wise.

          from  what is described in the subject, a new, more descriptive, subject <B>SHOULD</B> be substituted  (with  no  back  reference).   An  article whose subject begins with a back reference <B>MUST</B> have a References header referencing  the  precursor.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  A  back  reference  is FOUR characters, the

   this.   Observe  also that only ONE back reference

<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> There is a semi-standard  convention,  often

<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> Some  old  news  software  takes  a  subject

<P>
          The subject <B>SHOULD</B> be terse.  Posters <B>SHOULD</B> avoid trying to

          Encoded words used in newsgroup names <B>MUST</B> not contain characters  other than letters, digits, "+", "-", "/", "_", "=",
          and "?"  (although they may encode them).
<P>
          A newsgroup name consists of one or more  components,  which
          may  be  plain  components or (except for the first) encoded
          words.  A plain component <B>MUST</B> contain at least one  letter,
          <B>MUST</B>  begin  with  a letter or digit, and <B>MUST</B> not be longer
          than 14 characters.  The first component <B>MUST</B> begin  with  a
          letter;  subsequent  components  <B>SHOULD</B> begin with a letter.
          Newsgroup names <B>MUST</B> not contain uppercase  letters,  except
          where required by encodings in encoded words.  The sequences
          "all" and "ctl" <B>MUST</B> not be used as components.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> The alphabet  and  syntax  specified  encompasses  all  existing  names  of  widespread newsgroups, while  avoiding  various  forms  that  are
   known to cause problems.  Important existing software uses various non-alphanumeric  characters  as
   punctuation  adjacent  to  newsgroup  names.   (It
   would, in fact, be  preferable  to  ban  "+"  from
   newsgroup   names,   were   it  not  that  several
   widespread newsgroups related to the C++  programming language already use it.)
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  Much  existing  software converts the newsgroup name into a directory path  and  stores  the
   articles  themselves  using  numeric filenames, so
   all-digit name components can be troublesome;  the
   "Great  Renaming"  early  in the history of Usenet
   included revisions of several newsgroup  names  to
   eliminate such components.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> The same storage technique is the reason for
   the 14-character limit.  The limit is now  largely
   historical,  since  most  modern systems have much
   larger limits on the length of a directory entry's
   name, but many old systems are still in use.  Systems with shorter  limits  also  exist,  but  news
   software  on such systems has had to deal with the
   problem   already,   since   there   are   several
   widespread newsgroups with 14-character components
   in their names.  Implementors are warned  that  it
   is  intended that the successor to this Draft will
   increase the 14-character limit, and are urged  to
   fix  their  software to handle longer names gracefully (if such  fixes  are  necessary,  given  the
   intended  domain  of application of the particular
   software).
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> The requirement that the first character  of
   a  name be a letter accommodates existing software
   which assumes it can tell the difference between a
   newsgroup  name and other possible syntactic entities by inspecting the first  character.   Similar
   considerations  motivate  excluding  "+", "-", and
   "_" from coming first  in  a  component,  and  the
   preference  for  components that do not begin with
   digits.  The "all" sequence is used as a  wildcard
   symbol  in  much  existing software, and the "ctl"
   sequence was involved in  an  obsolete  historical
   mechanism  for  marking  control messages, so they
   are best avoided.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> Possibly newsgroup names  should  have  been
   case-insensitive, but all existing software treats
   them as case-sensitive.   (<A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc0977.gz"> RFC 977 </A>  [rrr]  claims
   that they are case-insensitive in NNTP, but existing implementations are believed to ignore  this.)
   The simplest solution is just to ban use of uppercase letters, since no widespread  newsgroup  name
   uses  them  anyway; this avoids any possibility of
   confusion.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> The syntax has the disadvantage of  containing  no  white space, making it impossible to continue a Newsgroups header  across  several  lines.
   Implementors  of  relayers  and reading agents are
   warned that it is intended that the  successor  to
   this  Draft will change the definition of ng-delim
   to:
<P>
<PRE>
        ng-delim = "," [ space ]
</PRE>
<P>
   and are urged to  fix  their  software  to  handle
   (i.e.,  ignore)  white space following the commas.
   Meanwhile, posters must avoid inserting such space
   (despite  the  natural-language  convention  which
   permits it) and posting  agents  should  strip  it
   out.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  Encoded  words  as  components are somewhat
   problematic, but are clearly desirable for use  in
   non-English-speaking  nations.   They are not subject to the 14-character limit, and this (plus the
   possibility  of  "/" within them) may require special handling in news software.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Encoded words are allowed in newsgroup names ONLY where nonASCII characters are necessary to the name, and must use the
          "b" encoding [rrr] and the first suitable character  set  in
          the MIME order of preferred character sets [rrr].
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  Since  the  newsgroup  name  is the encoded
   form, NOT the underlying non-ASCII form, there  is
   room  for terrible confusion here if the choice of
   encoding for a particular name is not fully  standardized.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Posters  <B>SHOULD</B> use only the names of existing newsgroups in
          the Newsgroups header, because newsgroups  are  NOT  created
          simply  by  being  posted  to.  However, it is legitimate to
          cross-post to newsgroup(s) which do not exist on the posting
          agent's  host,  provided that at least one of the newsgroups
          DOES exist there,  and  followup  agents  <B>MUST</B>  accept  this
          (posting agents MAY accept it, but <B>SHOULD</B> at least alert the
          poster to the situation and request confirmation).  Relayers
          <B>MUST</B> not rewrite Newsgroups headers in any way, even if some
          or all of the newsgroups do not exist on the relayer's host.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  Early  experience  with  news software that
   created newsgroups when they were mentioned  in  a
   Newsgroups header was thoroughly negative: posters
   frequently mistype newsgroup names.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> While it is legitimate for some of an  article's newsgroups not to exist on the host where it
   is posted, this  IS  a  rather  unusual  situation
   except  in followups (which should go to all newsgroups the precursor was posted to,  even  if  not
   all  of  them reach the site where the followup is
   being posted).
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  Rewriting  Newsgroups  headers   to   strip
   locally-unknown    newsgroups   is   superficially
   attractive.   However,   early   experience   with
   exactly  that policy was thoroughly negative: news
   propagation  is  more  redundant  and  much   less
   orderly  than many people imagine, and in particular it  is  not  unheard-of  for  the  (sometimes)
   fastest  path between two (say) U of Toronto sites
   to pass outside U  of  Toronto...  in  which  case
   newsgroup  stripping can cause incomplete propagation.   Having  an  article's  set  of  newsgroups
   change   as  it  propagates  can  also  result  in
   followups not achieving the  same  propagation  as
   the  original.  It's been tried; it's more trouble
   than it's worth; don't do it.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> In particular, newsgroup stripping  superficially  looks  like  a  solution to the problem of
   duplicate regional newsgroup names.  For  example,
   both University of Toronto and University of Texas
   have "ut.general" newsgroups, and material  crossposted to that name and a global newsgroup appears
   in both universities' local newsgroups.   However,
   the  side  effects  of  stripping are sufficiently
   unacceptable to disqualify it  for  this  purpose.
   Don't do it.

<P>
          Cross-posting  an  article to several relevant newsgroups is
          far superior to posting separate  articles  with  duplicated
          content to each newsgroup, because reading agents can detect
          the situation and show the article to a  reader  only  once.
          Posters <B>SHOULD</B> cross-post rather than duplicate-post.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  On the other hand, cross-posting to a large
   number of newsgroups usually  indicates  that  the
   poster  has  not thought about his audience; articles are rarely pertinent to more than (say)  half
   a  dozen newsgroups.  Posting agents might wish to
   request confirmation when the number of newsgroups
   exceeds  (say) five in the presence of a FollowupTo header, or (say) two in the absence of  such  a
   header.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  One  problem with cross-postings is what to
   do with an article cross-posted to a set of  newsgroups  including  both  moderated and unmoderated
   ones.  Posters tend to expect such an  article  to
   show up immediately in the unmoderated newsgroups,
   especially if they do not realize that one or more
   of the newsgroups is moderated.  However, since it
   is not possible for a moderator  to  retroactively
   add an already-posted article to a moderated newsgroup, the only correct action is to mail such  an
   article  to  one  (and only one) of the moderators
   for action.  It is probably best for  the  posting
   agent  to detect this situation and ask the poster
   what action is preferred.  The acceptable  choices
   are  to  alter  the newsgroup list or to mail to a
   moderator of  the  poster's  choice;  the  posting
   agent  should  NOT  offer  duplicate-posting as an
   easy-to-request option (if only because many  moderators  will reject a submission that has already
   been posted to unmoderated newsgroups).
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> An article cross-posted to  multiple  moderated  newsgroups  really should have approval from
   all the moderators  involved.   In  practice,  the
   only straightforward way to do this is to send the
   article to one of them and have  him  consult  the
   others.

<P>
          A  newsgroup  <B>SHOULD</B>  not appear more than once in the Newsgroups header.
<P>
          Newsgroup names having only one component are  reserved  for
          newsgroups  whose propagation is restricted to a single host
          (or the administrative equivalent).  It  is  inadvisable  to
          name  a  newsgroup  "poster"  because  that word has special
          meaning in the Followup-To header (see  <A HREF = "#6.1"> section 6.1 </A>).   The
          names  "control"  and "junk" are frequently used for pseudonewsgroups internal to relayer  implementations,  and  hence
          are also best avoided.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  Beware of the duplicate-regional-newsgroupnames problem  mentioned  above.   In  particular,
   there  are many, many hosts with a newsgroup named
   "general", and some surprising things show  up  in
   such  newsgroups  when  people  cross-post.  It is
   probably  better  to  use  multi-component  names,
   which  are  less  likely to be duplicated.  Fred's
   Widget House should use "fwh.general" rather  than
   just  "general"  as  its  in-house  general-topics
   newsgroup.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          It is conventional to reserve newsgroup names beginning with
          "to."  for  test  messages  sent on an essentially point-topoint basis (see also the ihave/sendme protocol described in
          <A HREF = "#7.2"> section 7.2 </A>);  newsgroup  names beginning with "to." <B>SHOULD</B>
          not be used for any other purpose.  The second (and possibly
          later)  components of such a name should, together, comprise
          the relayer name (see <A HREF = "#5.6"> section 5.6 </A>) of a relayer.  The  newsgroup  exists  only  at the named relayer and its neighbors.
          The neighbors all pass that newsgroup to the named  relayer,
          while the named relayer does not pass it to anyone.
<P>
          The order of newsgroup names in the Newsgroups header is not
          significant.

<P>
          <H3><A NAME="5.6">5.6. Path</A></H3>
<P>
          The Path header's content indicates which relayers the article  has  already  visited,  so  that  unnecessary redundant
          transmission can be avoided:
<P>
<PRE>
   Path-content    = [ path-list path-delimiter ] local-part
   path-list       = relayer-name *( path-delimiter relayer-name )
   relayer-name    = 1*rn-char
   rn-char         = letter / digit / "." / "-" / "_"
   path-delimiter  = "!"
</PRE>
<P>
          The Path content is a list of relayer  names,  separated  by
          path  delimiters,  followed (after a final delimiter) by the
          local part of a mailing address.  Each relayer <B>MUST</B>  prepend
          its  name, and a delimiter, to the Path content in all articles it processes.  A relayer <B>MUST</B> not pass an article to  a
          neighboring  relayer  whose  name is already mentioned in an
          article's path list, unless this is explicitly requested  by
          the  neighbor  in  some  way.   The  Path  content  is casesensitive.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> The Path header supplied by a posting  agent
   should  normally contain only the local part.  The
   relayer that the posting agent passes the  article
   to  for  posting  will prepend its relayer name to
   get the path list started.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> Observe that the trailing local part is  NOT
   part of the path list.  This Path header:
<P>
<PRE>
       Path: fee!fie!foe!fum
</PRE>
<P>
   contains  three  relayer names:  "fee", "fie", and
   "foe".  A relayer named "fum" is still eligible to
   be sent this article.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> This syntax has the disadvantage of containing no white space, making it impossible  to  continue  a Path header across several lines.  Implementors of relayers and reading agents are  warned
   that  it  is  intended  that the successor to this
   Draft will change the definition of path delimiter
   to:
<P>
<PRE>
        path-delimiter = "!" [ space ]
</PRE>
<P>
   and  are  urged  to  fix  their software to handle
   (i.e., ignore) white space following the  exclamation  points.   They are urged to hurry; some illbehaved systems reportedly already  feel  free  to
   add such white space.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A> allows considerably more flexibility in choice of delimiter, in  theory,  but  this
   flexibility  has  never  been  used  and most news
   software does  not  implement  it  properly.   The
   grammar  reflects  the  current reality.  Note, in
   particular, that <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A> treats "_" as  a  delimiter, but in fact it is known to appear in relayer
   names occasionally.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Because an article will not propagate to a  relayer  already
          mentioned  in  its path list, the path list <B>MUST</B> not contain
          any names other than  those  of  relayers  the  article  has
          passed  through AS NEWS.  This is trivially obvious for normal news articles, but requires attention from  the  moderators  of moderated newsgroups and the implementors and maintainers of gateways.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> For the  same  reason,  a  relayer  and  its
   neighbors  need  to agree on the choice of relayer
   name, and names  should  not  be  changed  without
   notifying neighbors.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Relayer  names  need  to  be unique among all relayers which
          will ever see the articles using them.  A  relayer  name  is
          normally  either an "official" name for the host the relayer
          runs on, or some other "official"  name  controlled  by  the
          same organization.  Except in cooperating subnets that agree
          to some other convention, and don't let  articles  using  it
          escape  beyond  the  subnet, a relayer name <B>MUST</B> be either a
          UUCP name registered in the UUCP maps  (without  any  domain
          suffix such as ".UUCP"), or a complete Internet domain name.
          Use of a (registered) UUCP name is recommended, where  practical, to keep the length of the path list down.
<P>
          The  use  of Internet domain names in the path list presents
          one problem: domain names are case-insensitive, but the path
          list  is  case-sensitive.   Relayers  using  domain names as
          their relayer names <B>MUST</B> pick a standard form for the  name,
          and  use that form consistently to the exclusion of all others.  The preferred form for this  purpose,  which  relayers
          <B>SHOULD</B> use, is the all-lowercase form.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  It  is  arguably  unfortunate that the path
   list is case-sensitive, but it is much too late to
   change  this.   Most  Internet  sites  do,  in any
   event, use one standardized  form  of  their  name
   almost everywhere.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          In  the ordinary case, where the poster is the author of the
          article, the local part following the path  list  <B>SHOULD</B>  be
          the  local part of the poster's full Internet domain mailing
          address.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> It should be just the local  part,  not  the
   full  address.   The character "@" does not appear
   in a Path header.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          The Path content somewhat resembles a mailing address,  particularly  in the UUCP world with its manual routing and "!"
          address syntax.  Historically, this resemblance  was  important,  and  the  Path  content  was  often  used  as a reply
          address.  This practice has always been somewhat unreliable,
          since  news paths are not always mail paths and news relayer
          names are not always recognized by mail  handlers,  and  its
          reliability  has  generally  worsened  in recent times.  The
          widespread  use  of  and  recognition  of  Internet   domain
          addresses,  even  outside  the  actual Internet, has largely
          eliminated the problem.  Readers <B>SHOULD</B>  not  use  the  Path
          content  as  a  reply  address.   On the other hand, relayer
          administrators are urged not to  break  this  usage  without
          good  reason; where practical, paths followed by news <B>SHOULD</B>
          be traversable by mail, and mail handlers  <B>SHOULD</B>  recognize
          relayer names as host names.
<P>
          It  will  typically be difficult or impractical for gateways
          and moderators to supply a Path content that is useful as  a
          reply  address for the author, bearing in mind that the path
          list they supply will normally be empty.  (To reiterate: the
          path  list  <B>MUST</B>  not  contain any names other than those of
          relayers the article has  passed  through  AS  NEWS.)   They
          <B>SHOULD</B>  supply a local part that will result in replies to a
          Path-derived address being returned to  the  sender  with  a
          brief  explanation.   Software  permitting,  the  local part
          "not-for-mail" is recommended.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> A moderator  or  gateway  administrator  who
   supplies  a  local part that delivers such mail to
   an administrative mailbox  will  quickly  discover
   why  it  should  be  bounced automatically!  It is
   best, however, for the returned message to include
   an  explanation  of  what  has  probably happened,
   rather than just a mysterious "undeliverable mail"
   complaint,  since the sender may not be aware that
   his/her software is unwisely using the  Path  content  as  a  reply  address.  Reply software might
   wish to question attempts  to  reply  to  a  Pathderived address ending in "not-for-mail" (which is
   why a specific name is being recommended here).

          Many MAIL headers, and many of those  specified  in  present

          news.  Headers specific to MAIL's  point-to-point  transmission  paradigm,  e.g.  To  and Cc, <B>SHOULD</B> not appear in news
          articles.  (Gateways wishing to  preserve  such  information
          for debugging probably <B>SHOULD</B> hide it under different names;
          prefixing "X-" to the original headers,  resulting  in  e.g.
          "X-To", is suggested.)
<P>
          The  following  optional headers are either specific to news
          or of particular note in news articles; an article MAY  contain some or all of them.  (Note that there are some circumstances in which some  of  them  are  mandatory;  these  are
          explained  under  the  individual headers.)  An article <B>MUST</B>
          not contain two or more headers with any one of these header names.
<P>
	<DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> The ban on duplicate header names  does  not

          The Followup-To header contents specify  which  newsgroup(s)
          followups should be posted to:
<P>
<PRE>
   Followup-To-content = Newsgroups-content / "poster"
</PRE>
<P>
          The  syntax  is  the same as that of the Newsgroups content,
          with the exception that the magic word "poster"  means  that
          followups  should  be  mailed to the article's reply address
          rather than posted.  In  the  absence  of  Followup-To,  the
          default  newsgroup(s)  for a followup are those in the Newsgroups header.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> The way to request that followups be  mailed
   to  a specific address other than that in the From
   line is  to  supply  "Followup-To: poster"  and  a
   Reply-To header.  Putting a mailing address in the
   Followup-To  line  is  incorrect;  posting  agents
   should reject or rewrite such headers.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>   There  is  no  syntax  for  "no  followups
   allowed"  because   "Followup-To: poster"   accomplishes this effect without extra machinery.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Although it is generally desirable to limit followups to the
          smallest reasonable set of newsgroups, especially  when  the
          precursor was cross-posted widely, posting agents <B>SHOULD</B> not
          supply a Followup-To header except at the poster's  explicit
          request.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> In particular, it is incorrect for the posting agent to assume that  followups  to  a  crossposted  article  should  be  directed to the first

   agent's.  However, when an article is to be crossposted  to  a considerable number of newsgroups, a

          The  Expires  header  content specifies a date and time when

          removed ("expired"):
<P>
<PRE>
   Expires-content = Date-content
</PRE>
<P>
          The  content syntax is the same as that of the Date content.
          In the absence of Expires, the default  is  decided  by  the
          administrators  of  each  host  the article reaches, who MAY
          also restrict the extent to which the Expires header is honored.
<P>
          The Expires header has two main applications: removing articles whose utility ends on  a  specific  date  (e.g.,  event
          announcements which can be removed once the day of the event
          is past) and preserving articles expected to be of prolonged
          usefulness  (e.g.,  information  aimed  at  new readers of a
          newsgroup).  The latter  application  is  sometimes  abused.
          Since individual hosts have local policies for expiration of
          news (depending on  available  disk  space,  for  instance),
          posters  <B>SHOULD</B>  not  provide  Expires  headers for articles
          unless there is a natural expiration  date  associated  with
          the  topic.   Posting  agents  <B>MUST</B>  not  provide  a default
          Expires header.  Leave it out and allow local policies to be
          used unless there is a good reason not to.  Expiry dates are
          properly the decision  of  individual  host  administrators;
          posters  and  moderators  <B>SHOULD</B>  set only expiry dates that
          most administrators would agree with.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> A poster preparing an Expires header for  an
   article  whose  utility  ends  on  a  specific day

<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  It  might  be  useful to preserve a postersupplied Sender header so that the poster can supply  the full-name part of the content.  The mailing address, however, must be right.   Hence,  the

   it is unable to verify the mailing  address  of  a
   poster-supplied one.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  NNTP implementors, in particular, are urged
   to note this requirement  (which  would  eliminate
   the  need  for  ad  hoc headers like NNTP-PostingHost), although there are admittedly  some  implementation  difficulties.   A user name from an <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1413.gz"> RFC 1413 </A> server and a host name from an  inverse  mapping  of  the  address, perhaps with a "full name"

   <B>NOTE:</B> In retrospect, <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc0850.gz"> RFCs 850 </A> and <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> 1036 </A>,  and  the
   implementations  whose  practice they represented,
   erred here.  The proper MAIL  header  to  use  for
   references  to  precursors is In-Reply-To, and the
   References header is meant to be used for the purposes  here ascribed to See-Also.  This incompatibility is far too solidly established to be fixed,
   unfortunately.   The  best  that can be done is to
   provide a clear mapping between the two, and  urge
   gateways to do the transformation.  The news usage
   is (now) a deliberate violation of the MAIL specifications;  articles  containing  news  References
   headers are technically not valid  MAIL  messages,
   although  it  is  unlikely that much MAIL software
   will notice because the incompatibility  is  at  a
   subtle  semantic  level  that  does not affect the
   syntax.
<P>
   <B>UNRESOLVED ISSUE:</B> Would it be better to just  give
   up  and  admit  that news uses References for both
   purposes?

<P>
   <B>UNRESOLVED ISSUE:</B> Should the syntax be generalized
   to  include  URLs  as alternatives to message IDs?
   Perhaps not; too many things know about References
   already.   And non-articles can't be precursors of
   articles, not really.
    </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Followup agents <B>SHOULD</B> not shorten References  headers.   If
          it  is absolutely necessary to shorten the header, as a desperate last resort, a followup agent MAY do this by deleting
          some  of  the  message IDs.  However, it <B>MUST</B> not delete the
          first message ID, the last three message IDs (including that
          of  the immediate precursor), or any message ID mentioned in
          the body of the followup.  If it is possible  for  the  followup agent to determine the Subject content of the articles
          identified in the References header, it <B>MUST</B> not delete  the
          message  ID of any article where the Subject content changed
          (other than by prepending of a back  reference).   The  followup  agent <B>MUST</B> not delete any message ID whose local part
          ends with "_-_" (underscore (ASCII 95), hyphen  (ASCII  45),
          underscore);  followup  agents are urged to use this form to
          mark subject changes, and to avoid using it otherwise.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> As software capable of exploiting References
   chains  has grown more common, the random shortening permitted by <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A> has become  increasingly
   troublesome.   ANY  shortening is undesirable, and
   software should do it only in cases of dire necessity.  In such cases, these rules attempt to limit
   the damage.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> The first message ID is  very  important  as
   the  starting point of the "thread" of discussion,
   and absolutely should not be deleted.  Keeping the
   last  three  message  IDs  gives  thread-following
   software a fighting chance to reconstruct  a  full
   thread  even  if  an  article  or  two is missing.
   Keeping message IDs mentioned in the body is obviously desirable.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  Subject changes are difficult to determine,
   but they are significant as possible beginnings of
   new  threads.  The "_-_" convention is provided so
   that posting agents (which have  more  information
   about  subjects)  can  flag  articles containing a
   subject change in a way that followup  agents  can
   detect  without access to the articles themselves.
   The sequence is  chosen  as  one  that  is  fairly
   unlikely to occur by accident.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> Is "_-_" really worth having?
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          When a References header is shortened, at least three blanks
          <B>SHOULD</B> be left between adjacent message IDs  at  each  point

<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  It's desirable to have some marker of where
   deletions occurred, but the restricted  syntax  of
   the  header  makes  this  difficult.   Extra white
   space is not a very good marker, since it  may  be
   deleted  by  software  that ill-advisedly rewrites
   headers, but at least it  doesn't  break  existing
   software.

<P>
          To  repeat:  followup  agents  <B>SHOULD</B> not shorten References
          headers.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  Unfortunately,  reading  agents  and  other
   software  analyzing References patterns have to be
   prepared for the worst anyway.  The worst includes
   random  deletions  and the possibility of circular
   References chains (when References is  misused  in
   place of See-Also, <A HREF = "#6.16"> section 6.16 </A>).

<P>
          <H3><A NAME="6.6">6.6. Control</A></H3>
<P>
          The  Control  header  content marks the article as a control
          message, and specifies the desired actions (other  than  the
          usual ones of filing and passing on the article):
<P>
<PRE>
   Control-content  = verb *( space argument )
   verb             = 1*( letter / digit )
   argument         = 1*&lt;ASCII printable character&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
          The  verb  indicates  what  action  should be taken, and the
          argument(s) (if any) supply details.   In  some  cases,  the
          body  of  the  article  may also contain details. <A HREF="#7"> Section 7</A>
          describes the standard verbs.   See  also  the  Also-Control
          header (<A HREF = "#6.15"> section 6.15 </A>).
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  Control  messages  are  often processed and
   filed rather differently than normal articles.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> The restriction of verbs to letters and digits  is new, but is consistent with existing practice and potentially simplifies implementation  by
   avoiding  characters significant to command interpreters.  Beware that the arguments are  under  no
   such restriction in general.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  Two  other  conventions  for distinguishing
   control messages from normal  articles  were  formerly  in  use:  a  three-component newsgroup name
   ending in  ".ctl"  or  a  subject  beginning  with
   "cmsg "  was  considered to imply that the article
   was a  control  message.   These  conventions  are
   obsolete.  Do not use them.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
An  article  with  a  Control  header MUST not have an Also-Control or Supersedes header.

<P>
          <H3><A NAME="6.7">6.7. Distribution</A></H3>
<P>
          The  Distribution  header  content  specifies  geographic or
          organizational limits on an article's propagation:
<P>
<PRE>
   Distribution-content  = distribution *( dist-delim distribution )
   dist-delim            = ","
   distribution          = plain-component
</PRE>
<P>
          A distribution is syntactically identical to a one-component
          newsgroup name, and must satisfy the same rules and restrictions.  In the absence of Distribution, the default  distribution is "world".
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> This syntax has the disadvantage of containing no white space, making it impossible  to  continue  a Distribution header across several lines.
   Implementors of relayers and  reading  agents  are
   warned  that  it is intended that the successor to
   this Draft will  change  the  definition  of  dist
   delimiter to:
<P>
<PRE>
        dist-delim = "," [ space ]
</PRE>
<P>
   and  are  urged  to  fix  their software to handle
   (i.e., ignore) white space following the commas.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          A relayer <B>MUST</B> not pass an article to another relayer unless
          configuration  information  specifies  transmission  to that
          other relayer of BOTH (a) at  least  one  of  the  article's
          newsgroup(s),  and (b) at least one of the article's distribution(s).  In effect, the only role of distributions is  to
          limit  propagation,  by  preventing transmission of articles
          that would have been transmitted had the decision been based
          solely on newsgroups.
<P>
          A  posting  agent  might  wish to present a menu of possible
          distributions, or suggest a default, but normally <B>SHOULD</B> not
          supply a default without giving the poster a chance to override it.  A followup agent <B>SHOULD</B> initially supply the  same
          Distribution  header as found in the precursor, although the
          poster MAY alter this if appropriate.
<P>
          Despite the syntactic similarity and some historical  confusion,  distributions  are  NOT  newsgroup  names.  The whole
          point of putting a distribution on an article is that it  is
          DIFFERENT  from  the newsgroup(s).  In general, a meaningful
          distribution corresponds to some sort of region of  propagation: a geographical area, an organization, or a cooperating
          subnet.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  Distributions  have  historically  suffered
   from  the  completely uncontrolled nature of their
   name space, the lack of  feedback  to  posters  on
   incomplete  propagation resulting from use of random trash in Distribution headers,  and  confusion
   with   newsgroups  (arising  partly  because  many
   regions and organizations DO have  internal  newsgroups  with  names resembling their internal distributions).  This has resulted in much garbage in
   Distribution  headers, notably the pointless practice of automatically supplying the  first  component  of  the  newsgroup  name  as  a distribution
   (which is MOST unlikely to restrict propagation!).
   Many  sites  have opted to maximize propagation of
   such ill-formed articles by  essentially  ignoring
   distributions.  This unfortunately interferes with
   legitimate uses.  The situation is bad enough that
   distributions  must  be considered largely useless
   except within cooperating  subnets  that  make  an
   organized  effort to restrain propagation of their
   internal distributions.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> The distributions "world" and  "local"  have
   no  standard magic meaning (except that the former
   is the default distribution  if  none  is  given).
   Some pieces of software do assign such meanings to
   them.

          <H3><A NAME="6.8">6.8. Keywords</A></H3>
<P>
          The Keywords header content is one or more phrases  intended

<P>
<PRE>
   Keywords-content = plain-phrase *( "," [ space ] plain-phrase )
</PRE>
<P>
          Keywords,  separated  by  commas,  each  follow  the &lt;plainphrase&gt; syntax defined in <A HREF = "#5.2"> section 5.2 </A>.   Encoded  words  in
          keywords  <B>MUST</B> not contain characters other than letters (of
          either case), digits, and the characters "!", "*", "+", "-",
          "/", "=", and "_".
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> Posters and posting agents are asked to take
   note that keywords are separated by commas, not by
   white  space.   The following Keywords header contains only one  keyword  (a  rather  unlikely  and
   improbable one):
<P>
<PRE>
        Keywords: Thompson Ritchie Multics Linux
</PRE>
<P>
   and should probably have been written:
<P>

        Keywords: Thompson, Ritchie, Multics, Linux
</PRE>
<P>
   This  particular  error  is  unfortunately  rather
   widespread.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  Reading  agents  and  archivers   preparing
   indexes of articles should bear in mind that userchosen keywords are notoriously poor for  indexing
   purposes  unless  the  keywords  are picked from a
   predefined set (which they are not in this  case).
   Also,  some followup agents unwisely propagate the
   Keywords header from the precursor into  the  followup by default.  At least one news-based experiment has found the contents of Keywords headers to
   be completely valueless for indexing.

<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> Reading agents should be aware that the Summary header is often used as a sort  of  secondary

   displayed.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          The summary <B>SHOULD</B> be terse.  Posters <B>SHOULD</B> avoid trying to

<P>
          <H3><A NAME="6.10">6.10. Approved</A></H3>
<P>
          The  Approved header content indicates the mailing addresses
          (and possibly the full names) of  the  persons  or  entities
          approving the article for posting:
<P>
<PRE>
   Approved-content = From-content *( "," [ space ] From-content )
</PRE>
<P>
          An  Approved header is required in all postings to moderated
          newsgroups; the presence or absence of this header allows  a
          posting  agent to distinguish between articles posted by the
          moderator (which are normal articles to be posted  normally)
          and  attempted  contributions  by  others  (which  should be
          mailed to the moderator for approval).  An  Approved  header
          is  also required in certain control messages, to reduce the
          probability of accidental posting of same; see the  relevant
          parts of <A HREF = "#7."> section 7. </A>
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> There is, at present, no way to authenticate
   Approved  headers  to  ensure  that  the   claimed
   approval  really  was  bestowed.   Nor is there an
   established mechanism for even maintaining a  list
   of legitimate approvers (such a list would quickly
   become out of date if it had to be  maintained  by
   hand).   Such  mechanisms,  presumably  relying on
   cryptographic authentication, would  be  a  worthwhile  extension  to  this Draft, and experimental
   work in this area is encouraged.  (The problem  is
   harder than it sounds because news is used on many
   systems which do not have real-time access to  key
   servers.)
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  Relayer  implementors, please note well: it
   is the POSTING AGENT that is authorized to distinguish  between  moderator  postings  and attempted

   <B>MUST</B> not, repeat <B>MUST</B>  not,  send  such  mail;  on

   transform  it  into a mail message (except perhaps
   to a local administrator).
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A> restricted  Approved  to  a  single

<P>
          The line count includes all body lines, including the signature  if any, including empty lines (if any) at beginning or

          the  headers  and  the  body  is not part of the body.)  The
          "body" here is the body as  found  in  the  posted  article,
          AFTER all transformations such as MIME encodings.
<P>
          Reading  agents  <B>SHOULD</B>  not  rely  on  the presence of this
          header, since it is optional (and some posting agents do not
          supply  it).   They <B>MUST</B> not rely on it being precise, since
          it frequently is not.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> The average line length in article bodies is
   surprisingly  consistent  at  about 40 characters,
   and since the line count typically  is  used  only
   for  approximate  judgements ("is this too long to
   read quickly?"), dividing the byte  count  of  the
   body  by  40  gives  an  estimate of the body line
   count that is adequate for normal use.  This estimate  is  NOT  adequate  if the body has been MIME
   encoded... but neither is the Lines header,  since
   at  least  one  major  relayer will supply a Lines
   header for an article that lacks one, and will not
   consider  the  possibility  of MIME encodings when
   computing the line count.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> It would be better to  have  a  Content-Size
   header  as  part of MIME, so that body parts could
   have their own sizes, and so that the  units  used

          whether  it  really  was  the  one that filed the copy being
          examined).  The locations specify what newsgroups the  article  was  filed  under  (which  may differ from those in the

          exact form of an article locator is implementation-specific.

          An article with an Also-Control header is filed  and  passed
          on  normally,  but the content of the Also-Control header is
          processed as if it were found in a Control header.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> It is sometimes desirable to piggyback  control  actions  on  a  normal  article, so that the
   article will be filed normally but  will  also  be
   acted  on  as  a  control message.  This header is
   essentially a generalization of Supersedes.

<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  See-Also  provides  a  way to group related

<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> In the specific case where it is desired  to
   essentially  make another article PART of the current one, e.g. for annotation of the  other  article, MIME's "message/external-body" convention can
   be used to do so without actual inclusion.  "newsmessage-ID" was registered as a standard externalbody access method, with a mandatory NAME  parameter  giving  the  message  ID and an optional SITE
   parameter suggesting an NNTP site that might  have
   the  article  available  (if  it  is not available
   locally), by IANA 22 June 1993.
   <P>
   <B>UNRESOLVED  ISSUE:</B> Could the syntax be generalized

          The Article-Names header content indicates any special  significance the article may have in particular newsgroups:

<PRE>
   Article-Names-content  = 1*( name-clause space )
   name-clause            = newsgroup-name ":" article-name
   article-name           = letter 1*( letter / digit / "-" )
</PRE>
<P>
          Each  name  clause  specifies  a  newsgroup (which <B>SHOULD</B> be
          among those in the Newsgroups header) and  an  article  name
          local  to  that  newsgroup.   Article  names  MAY be used by
          relayers to file the article in special ways,  or  they  MAY
          just  be  noted  for  possible  special attention by reading
          agents.  Article names are case-sensitive.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> This header provides a way to  mark  special
   postings, such as introductions, frequently-askedquestion lists, etc., so that reading agents  have
   a  way  of  finding them automatically.  The newsgroup name is  specified  for  each  article  name
   because  the  names may be newsgroup-specific; for
   example, many frequently-asked-question lists  are
   posted  to  "news.answers"  in  addition  to their
   "home" newsgroup, and they would not be  known  by
   the same name(s) in both newsgroups.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          The  Article-Names header <B>SHOULD</B> be ignored unless the article also contains an Approved header.

<P>
          The presence of an Article-Names header does not necessarily
          imply  that  the  article  will  be  retained unusually long
          before expiration, or that previous article(s) with  similar
          Article-Names  headers  will  be  cancelled  by its arrival.
          Posters preparing special postings <B>SHOULD</B> include  appropriate  other  headers,  such  as  Expires  and  Supersedes, to
          request such actions.
<P>
          Different networks MAY establish different sets  of  article
          names  for the special postings they deem significant; it is
          preferable for usage to  be  standardized  within  networks,
          although  it might be desirable for individual newsgroups to
          have different naming conventions in some situations.  Article  names  <B>MUST</B>  be  14  characters or less.  The following
          names are suggested but are not mandatory:
<P>
          intro       Introduction to the newsgroup for newcomers.
<P>
          charter     Charter, rules, organization,  moderation  policies, etc.

          background  Biographies  of special participants, history of
          the newsgroup, notes on related newsgroups, etc.

          FTP repositories, etc.
<P>

<P>
          menu        If present, a list  of  all  the  other  article
          names   local  to  this  newsgroup,  with  brief
          descriptions of their contents.
<P>
          Such articles may be divided into subsections using the MIME
          "multipart/mixed"  conventions.  If size considerations make
          it necessary to split  such  articles,  names  ending  in  a
          hyphen  and  a  part  number  are  suggested; for example, a
          three-part frequently-asked-questions list could have  article names "faq-1", "faq-2", and "faq-3".
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> It is somewhat premature to attempt to standardize article names, since this is essentially a
   new  feature  with  no experience behind it.  However, if reading agents are to attach special significance to these names, some attempt at standard

   attempt at providing some.

<P>
<PRE>
   Article-Updates-content  = message-id *( space message-id )
</PRE>
<P>
          Each message ID identifies a previous article that this  one
          is  deemed  to  update.   This  <B>MUST</B> not cause the previous
          article(s) to be cancelled or otherwise altered, unless this
          is  implied  by  other  headers  (e.g. Supersedes); Article-Updates is merely an advisory which MAY be noted for  special attention by reading agents.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  This header provides a way to mark articles
   which are only minor  updates  of  previous  ones,
   containing  no significant new information and not
   worth reading if the previous ones have been read.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> If suitable conventions using MIME multipart
   bodies and the  "message/external-body"  body-part
   type  can  be developed, a replacing article might
   contain only differences between the old text  and
   the  new  text,  rather  than a complete new copy.
   This is the motivation  for  not  making  Article-Updates  also  function  as Supersedes does: the
   replacing article might depend  on  the  continued
   presence of the replaced article.

<P>
          <H3><A NAME="7">7. Control Messages</A></H3>
<P>
          The  following  sections document the currently-defined control messages.  "Message" is used herein as  a  synonym  for
          "article" unless context indicates otherwise.
<P>
          Posting  agents  are  warned that since certain control messages require article bodies in quite specific formats, signatures  <B>SHOULD</B> not be appended to such articles, and it may
          be wise to take greater care than usual to avoid  unintended
          (although perhaps well-meaning) alterations to text supplied
          by the poster.  Relayers <B>MUST</B> assume that  control  messages
          mean  what  they  say; they MAY be obeyed as is or rejected,
          but <B>MUST</B> not be reinterpreted.
<P>
          The execution of the actions requested by  control  messages
          is  subject  to local administrative restrictions, which MAY
          deny  requests  or  refer  them  to  an  administrator   for
          approval.   The  descriptions below are generally phrased in
          terms suggesting mandatory actions, but any or all of  these
          MAY be subject to local administrative approval (either as a
          class or case-by-case).  Analogously, where the  description
          below  specifies  that a message or portion thereof is to be
          ignored, this action MAY include reporting it to an administrator.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  The  exact  choice  of  local  action might
   depend  on  what  action   the   control   message
   requests, who it claims to come from, etc.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Relayers  <B>MUST</B>  propagate  even control messages they do not
          understand.
<P>
          In the following sections, each type of control  message  is
          defined  syntactically  by  defining  its  arguments and its
          body.  For example, "cancel" is defined by defining  cancelarguments and cancel-body.
<P>
<P>
          <H3><A NAME="7.1">7.1. cancel</A></H3>
<P>
          The  cancel message requests that one or more previous articles be "cancelled":
<P>
<PRE>
   cancel-arguments  = message-id *( space message-id )
   cancel-body       = body
</PRE>
<P>
          The argument(s) identify the articles to  be  cancelled,  by
          message  ID.   The  body  is  a comment, which software <B>MUST</B>
          ignore, and <B>SHOULD</B> contain an indication of why the  cancellation  was  requested.  The cancel message <B>SHOULD</B> be posted
          to the same newsgroup(s), with the same distribution(s),  as
          the article(s) it is attempting to cancel.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  Using the same newsgroups and distributions
   maximizes the chances of the cancel message propagating everywhere the target articles went.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A> permitted only a single message-id
   in a cancel message.  Support for cancelling  multiple articles is highly desirable, especially for
   use with Supersedes (see <A HREF = "#6.14"> section 6.14 </A>).   If  several  revisions  of an article appear in fast succession, each using Supersedes to cancel the  previous one, it is possible for a middle revision to
   be destroyed by cancellation before it  is  propagated  onward to cancel its predecessor.  Allowing
   each  article  to  cancel   several   predecessors
   greatly  alleviates this problem.  (Posting agents
   preparing a cancel of an article which itself cancels  other articles might wish to add those articles to the cancel-arguments.)   However,  posters
   should  be  aware  that much old software does not
   implement  multiple  cancellation  properly,   and
   should  avoid  using it when reliable cancellation
   is vitally important.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          When an article (the "target article") is to  be  cancelled,
          there are four cases of interest: the article hasn't arrived
          yet, it has arrived and been  filed  and  is  available  for
          reading,  it  has  expired  and  been archived on some lessaccessible storage  medium,  or  it  has  expired  and  been
          deleted.   The next few paragraphs discuss each case in turn
          (in reverse order, which is convenient for the explanation).
<P>
          EXPIRED AND DELETED.  Take no action.
<P>
          EXPIRED  AND ARCHIVED.  If the article is readily accessible
          and can be deleted or made unreadable easily, treat as under
          AVAILABLE  below.   Otherwise  treat  as  under  EXPIRED AND
          DELETED.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> While it is desirable for archived  articles
   to be cancellable, this can easily involve rewriting an entire archive volume just to  get  rid  of
   one  article, perhaps with manual actions required
   to arrange it.  It is difficult to envision a situation  so  dire  as to require such measures from
   hundreds or thousands of  administrators,  or  for
   that  matter  one  in  which widespread compliance
   with such a request is likely.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          AVAILABLE.  Compare the  mailing  addresses  from  the  From
          lines  of the cancel message and the target article, bearing
          in mind that local parts (except for "postmaster") are casesensitive  and domains are case-insensitive.  If they do not
          match, either refer the issue  to  an  administrator  for  a
          case-by-case decision, or treat as if they matched.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  It  is generally trivial to forge articles,
   so nothing short of  cryptographic  authentication
   is  really  adequate  to ensure that a cancel came
   from the original article's author.  Moreover,  it
   is  highly  desirable  to permit authorities other
   than the author to cancel articles, to  allow  for
   cases  in which the author is unavailable, uncooperative, or malicious, and in which damage  and/or
   legal  problems may be minimized by prompt cancellation.  Reliable authentication that would permit
   such  administrative cancels would be a worthwhile
   extension to this Draft, and experimental work  in
   this area is encouraged.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  Meanwhile,  a  simple check of addresses is
   useful accident prevention and  catches  at  least
   the  most simple-minded forgers.  Since the intent
   is accident prevention rather than ironclad  security,  use of the From address is appropriate, all
   the more so because in the  presence  of  gateways
   (especially   redundant  multiple  gateways),  the
   author may not have full control over Sender headers.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  The  "refer... or treat as if they matched"
   rule is intended to  specifically  forbid  quietly
   ignoring cancels with mismatched addresses.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          If  the  addresses  match, then if technically possible, the
          relayer <B>MUST</B> delete the target article completely and  immediately.   Failing  that,  it  <B>MUST</B>  make the target article
          unreadable (preferably to everyone,  minimally  to  everyone
          but  the  administrator)  and  either  arrange  for it to be
          deleted as soon as possible or notify  an  administrator  at
          once.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>   To  allow  for  events  such  as  criminal
   actions,  malicious   forgeries,   and   copyright
   infringements,  where damage and/or legal problems
   may be minimized by prompt cancellation,  complete
   removal  is  strongly preferred over merely making
   the target article unreadable.  The potential  for
   malice  is  outweighed by the importance of really
   getting rid of the target article in some  legitimate  cases.   (In  cases of inadvertent copyright
   violation in particular, the  ability  to  quickly
   remedy  the  violation  is  of  considerable legal
   importance.)  Failing that, making  it  unreadable
   is better than nothing.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  Merely annotating the article so that readers see an indication that the  author  wanted  it
   cancelled  is  not acceptable.  Making the article
   unreadable is the minimum action.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> There have been experiments with making cancelled  articles  unreadable,  so  that local news
   administrators could  reverse  cancellations.   In
   practice,  administrators  almost never find cause
   to do so.  Removal appears to be  clearly  preferable where technically feasible.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          NOT  ARRIVED  YET.   If practical, retain the cancel message
          until the target article does arrive, or until there  is  no
          further  possibility  of it arriving and being accepted (see
          <A HREF = "#9.2"> section 9.2 </A>), and then treat as  under  AVAILABLE.   Failing
          that, arrange for the target article to be rejected and discarded if it does arrive.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> It may well be  impractical  to  retain  the
   control  message,  given uncertainty about whether
   the target article  will  ever  arrive.   Existing
   practice in such cases is to assume that addresses
   would match and arrange the  equivalent  of  deletion.   This  is  often  done by making a spurious
   entry in a database of  already-seen  message  IDs
   (see  <A HREF = "#9.3"> section 9.3 </A>),  so  that if the article does
   arrive, it will be rejected as a duplicate.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          The cancel message <B>MUST</B> be propagated onward  in  the  usual
          fashion,  regardless  of which of the four cases applied, so
          that the target article will be cancelled everywhere even if
          cancellation and target article follow different routes.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A> appeared to require stopping cancel
   propagation in the NOT ARRIVED YET case,  although
   the wording was somewhat unclear.  This appears to
   have been an  unwise  decision;  there  are  known
   cases  of  important  cancellations (in situations
   of,   e.g.,   inadvertent   copyright   violation)
   achieving  rather poorer propagation than the target article.  News propagation  is  often  a  much
   less  orderly process than the authors of <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A>
   apparently  envisioned.   Modern   implementations
   generally propagate the cancellation regardless.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Posting  agents  meant  for  use  by ordinary posters <B>SHOULD</B>
          reject an attempt to post a cancel  message  if  the  target
          article  is  available  and  the mailing address in its From

<P>
          The ihave and sendme  control  messages  implement  a  crude
          batched  predecessor  of  the NNTP [rrr] protocol.  They are
          largely obsolete in the Internet, but still see use  in  the
          UUCP  environment, especially for backup feeds that normally
          are active only when a primary feed path has failed.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> The ihave and sendme messages  defined  here
   have  ABSOLUTELY  NOTHING TO DO WITH NNTP, despite
   similarities of terminology.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          The two messages share the same syntax:
<P>
<PRE>
   ihave-arguments   = *( message-id space ) relayer-name
   sendme-arguments  = ihave-arguments
   ihave-body        = *( message-id eol )
   sendme-body       = ihave-body
</PRE>
<P>
          Message IDs <B>MUST</B> appear in either the arguments or the body,
          but  not  both.   Relayers  <B>SHOULD</B> generate the form putting
          message IDs in the body, but the other  form  <B>MUST</B>  be  supported for backward compatibility.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A> made the relayer name optional, but
   difficulties could easily ensue in determining the
   origin of the message, and this option is believed
   to be unused nowadays.  Putting the message IDs in
   the  body  is strongly preferred over putting them
   in the arguments because it lends itself much better to large numbers of message IDs and avoids the
   empty-body problem mentioned in <A HREF = "#4.3.1"> section 4.3.1</A>.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          The ihave message states that the named  relayer  has  filed
          articles  with  the  specified  message IDs, which may be of
          interest to the relayer(s) receiving the ihave message.  The
          sendme  message  requests that the relayer receiving it send
          the articles having the specified message IDs to  the  named
          relayer.
<P>
          These  control  messages  are  normally  sent essentially as
          point-to-point messages, by using "to." newsgroups (see <A HREF = "#5.5"> section 5.5 </A>) that are sent only to the relayer the messages are
          intended for.  The two relayers <B>MUST</B> be neighbors,  exchanging  news directly with each other.  Each relayer advertises
          its new arrivals to the other using ihave messages, and each
          uses sendme messages to request the articles it lacks.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  Arguably  these point-to-point control messages should flow by  some  other  protocol,  e.g.
   mail,  but  administrative  and interfacing issues
   are simplified if the news system doesn't need  to
   talk to the mail system.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          To reduce overhead, ihave and sendme messages <B>SHOULD</B> be sent
          relatively infrequently and <B>SHOULD</B> contain substantial  numbers  of message IDs.  If ihave and sendme are being used to
          implement a backup feed, it may be  desirable  to  insert  a
          delay  between  reception  of  an  ihave and generation of a
          sendme, so that a slightly slow primary feed will not  cause
          large  numbers of articles to be requested unnecessarily via
          sendme.

          The  first  argument  names the newsgroup to be created, and
          the second one (if present) indicates whether it  is  moderated.   If  there  is  no  second  argument,  the default is
          "unmoderated".
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> Implementors are warned that there is  occasional  use of other forms in the second argument.
   It is  suggested  that  such  violations  of  this
   Draft,  which  are  also  violations  of <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A>,
   cause the newgroup message  to  be  ignored.   <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A> was slightly vague about how second arguments
   other than "moderated" were to be treated (specifically,   whether   they   were  illegal  or  just
   ignored), but it  is  thought  that  all  existing
   major  implementations  will  handle "unmoderated"
   correctly, and it appears desirable to tighten  up
   the  specs  to make it possible for other forms to
   be used in future.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          The body is a comment, which software  <B>MUST</B>  ignore,  except
          that  if  it  contains a descriptor, the description line is
          intended to be suitable for addition to a list of  newsgroup
          descriptions.   The  description  cannot  be  continued onto
          later lines,  but  is  not  constrained  to  any  particular
          length.   Moderated  newsgroups  have  descriptions that end
          with the string " (Moderated)" (note that this string begins
          with a blank).
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  It is unfortunate that the description line
   is part of the body, rather than being supplied in
   a header, but this is established practice.  Newsgroup creators are cautioned that  the  descriptor
   tag  must  be  reproduced  exactly as given above,
   alone on  a  line,  and  is  case-sensitive.   (To
   reduce errors in this regard, posting agents might
   wish to question or reject newgroup messages which
   do  not  contain  a descriptor.)  Given the desire
   for short lines, description writers should  avoid
   content-free  phrases  like  "discussion  of"  and
   "news about", and stick to defining what the newsgroup is about.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          The  remainder  of the body <B>SHOULD</B> contain an explanation of
          the purpose of the newsgroup and the decision to create  it.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  Criteria for newsgroup creation vary widely
   and are outside the scope of this  Draft,  but  if
   formal procedures of one kind or another were followed in the decision,  the  body  should  mention
   this.  Administrators often look for such information when deciding whether  to  comply  with  creation/deletion requests.

<P>
          A  newgroup  message  which lacks an Approved header <B>MUST</B> be
          ignored.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> It would also be desirable to ignore a  newgroup  message  unless its Approved header names a

   such  a newsgroup.  A cooperating subnet with sufficiently strong coordination to maintain  a  correct and current list of authorized creators might
   wish to do so for  its  internal  newsgroups.   It
   also  (or  alternatively)  might  wish to ignore a
   newgroup message for an  internal  newsgroup  that
   was  posted  (or  cross-posted)  to a non-internal
   newsgroup.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> As mentioned in <A HREF = "#6.10"> section 6.10 </A>, some  form  of

<P>
          It  would  be  desirable  to provide some way of supplying a
          moderator's address in a newgroup message  for  a  moderated
          newsgroup,  but  this  will  cause problems unless effective
          authentication is available, so it is left for future  work.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  This  leaves news administrators stuck with
   the annoying chore of arranging proper mailing  of
   moderated-newsgroup  submissions.  On Usenet, this
   can  be  simplified  by  exploiting  a  forwarding
   facility that some major sites provide: they maintain forwarding addresses, each the name of a moderated  newsgroup with all periods (".", ASCII 46)
   replaced by hyphens ("-", ASCII 45), which forward
   mail  to  the  current newsgroup moderators.  More
   advice on the subject of forwarding to  moderators
   can  be  found in the document titled "How to Construct the Mailpaths File",  posted  regularly  to
   the Usenet newsgroups news.lists, news.admin.misc,
   and news.answers.

          A newgroup message naming a newsgroup that already exists is

   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> Whogets is intended  as  a  replacement  for

   varies widely between different forms  of  relayer
   software,  the  only  practical way to standardize
   the reply format is to indicate a  specific  newsgroup  and  ask  where  THAT newsgroup propagates.
   The requirement that it be  a  complete  newsgroup
   name is intended to (largely) avoid the problem of
   having to answer "yes and no" in cases  where  not
   all newsgroups in a hierarchy are sent.

<P>
          Any  of  these  messages  lacking an Approved header <B>MUST</B> be

          delayed  for  at  least  24 hours, and no response should be
          attempted if the message has been cancelled  in  that  time.
          Also,  no response <B>SHOULD</B> be attempted unless the local part
          of the destination address is "newsmap".   News  administrators  <B>SHOULD</B>  arrange for mail to "newsmap" on their systems

<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  Because these messages can cause many, many
   relayers to send mail to  one  person,  such  messages,  specifying mailing to an innocent person's
   mailbox, have been forged as a half-witted practical  joke.   A  delay gives administrators time to
   notice a fraudulent message and act (by cancelling
   the message, preparing to divert the flood of mail
   into the bit bucket, or both).  Restriction of the
   destination   address  to  "newsmap"  reduces  the
   appeal of fraud by making it impossible to use  it
   to  harass  a normal user.  (A site which does NOT
   discard mail to "newsmap", but rather  bounces  it
   back,  may  incur higher communications costs than
   if the mail had been accepted into a user's  mailbox...  but  a  malicious  forger could accomplish
   this anyway, by using an address whose local  part
   is very unlikely to be a legitimate mailbox name.)
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A> did not require the Approved header

          The body of the reply to a sendsys message <B>SHOULD</B> be of  the

<P>
          The  first  line  identifies  the responding system, using a
          syntax resembling a header (but note that it is part of  the
          BODY).  Remaining lines indicate what newsgroups are sent to
          what other systems.  The syntax of newsgroup patterns is not
          well  standardized; the form described is common (often with
          newsgroup names only partially  given,  denoting  all  names
          starting  with  a particular set of components) but not universal.   The  whogets  message  provides  a  better-defined
          alternative.
<P>
          The  reply  to  a version message is of somewhat ill-defined
          form, with a body normally consisting of a  single  line  of
          text that somehow describes the version of the relayer software.  The whogets message provides a better-defined  alternative.
<P>
          The  body  of  the reply to a whogets message <B>MUST</B> be of the
          form:
<P>

<P>
          The first six lines identify the responding relayer  by  its
          Internet  domain  name  (use  of  the  ".uucp" and ".bitnet"
          pseudo-domains is permissible, for registered hosts in them,
          but discouraged) and its relayer name, specify the date when
          the reply was generated and the message ID  of  the  whogets
          message  being replied to, give the path list (from the Path
          header) of the whogets message  (which  MAY,  if  absolutely
          necessary,  be  truncated  to  a convenient length, but <B>MUST</B>
          contain at least the leading three relayer names), and indicate  the version of relayer software responding.  Note that
          these lines are part of the BODY even  though  their  format
          resembles  that  of  headers.   Despite the apparently-fixed
          order specified by the syntax above, they can appear in  any
          order, but there must be exactly one of each.
<P>
          After  those  preliminaries,  and an empty line to unambiguously define their end, the remaining lines are the  relayer
          names  (which MAY be accompanied by the corresponding domain
          names, if known) of  systems  which  the  responding  system
          passes  the  target  newsgroup  to.   Only the names of news
          relayers are to be included.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> It is desirable for a reply to identify  its
   source  by  both  domain  name  and  relayer  name
   because news propagation is governed by the latter
   but  location  in a broader context is best determined by the former.  The date and whogets message
   ID  should,  in  principle, be present in the MAIL
   headers, but are included in the body for  robustness  in  the  presence of uncooperative mail systems.  The reason for the path list  is  discussed
   below.   Adding version information eliminates the
   need for a separate message to gather it.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> The limitation of pass lines to contain only
   names  of  news relayers is meant to exclude names
   used within a single host (as identifiers for mail
   gateways,  portions  of  ihave/sendme  implementations, etc.), which do not actually refer to other
   hosts.

<P>
          A  relayer  which  is unaware of the existence of the target
          newsgroup <B>MUST</B> not  reply  to  a  whogets  message  at  all,
          although  this  <B>MUST</B>  not  influence decisions on whether to
          pass the article on to other relayers.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> While this may result in discontinuous  maps
   in   cases  where  some  hosts  have  not  honored
   requests for creation of a newsgroup, it will also

   that a whogets message intended  to  map  a  small
   region "leaks" out to a larger one.  The possibility of discontinuous recognition  of  a  newsgroup
   does  make  it  important that the whogets message
   itself continue to propagate  (if  other  criteria
   permit).   This  is also the reason for the inclusion of the whogets message's  path  list,  or  at
   least  the leading portion of it, in the reply: to
   permit reconstruction of at least  small  gaps  in
   maps.

   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          The checkgroups message applies to all hierarchies  containing  any  of  the newsgroups listed in the body.  The checkgroups message asserts that the newsgroups it lists are  the
          only newsgroups in those hierarchies.  If there is an invalidation, it asserts that the hierarchies it names no  longer
          contain any newsgroups.
<P>
          Processing  a  checkgroups message MAY cause a local list of
          newsgroup descriptions to be updated.  It <B>SHOULD</B> also  cause
          the  local  lists  of  newsgroups (and their moderation statuses) in the mentioned hierarchies to  be  checked  against
          the message.  The results of the check MAY be used for automatic corrective action, or MAY  be  reported  to  the  news
          administrator in some way.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>   Automatically   updating  descriptions  of
   existing newsgroups is relatively  safe.   In  the

   notifying the administrator is generally the  wisest  action,  unless  perhaps  the  message can be
   determined to have originated within a cooperating
   subnet whose members are considered trustworthy.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> There is a problem with the checkgroups concept:  not   all   newsgroups   in   a   hierarchy
   necessarily propagate to the same set of machines.
   (Notably, there is a set of  newsgroups  known  as
   the  "inet" newsgroups, which have relatively limited distribution but coexist in  several  hierarchies  with  more  widely-distributed newsgroups.)
   The advice of checkgroups should always  be  taken
   with a grain of salt, and should never be followed
   blindly.

          <H3><A NAME="8">8. Transmission Formats</A></H3>
<P>
          While this  Draft  does  not  specify  transmission  methods
          except  to  place  a few constraints on them, there are some
          data formats used only for transmission that are  unique  to
          news.
<P>
<P>
          <H3><A NAME="8.1">8.1. Batches</A></H3>
<P>
          For efficient bulk transmission and processing of news articles, it is often desirable to transmit a number of them  as
          a  single  block  of data, a "batch".  The format of a batch
          is:
<P>
<PRE>
   batch         = 1*( batch-header article )
   batch-header  = "#! rnews " article-size eol
   article-size  = 1*digit
</PRE>
<P>
          A batch is a sequence of articles, each prefixed by a header
          line  that includes its size.  The article size is a decimal
          count of the octets in the article, counting each EOL as one
          octet regardless of how it is actually represented.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> A relayer might wish to accept either a single article or a batch as input.  Since "#" cannot
   appear  in a header name, examination of the first
   octet of the input will reveal its nature.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> In the header line,  there  is  exactly  one
   blank  before  "rnews", there is exactly one blank
   after "rnews", and the EOL immediately follows the
   article  size.   Beware that some software inserts
   non-standard trash after the size.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> Despite the similarity of this format to the
   executable-script  format  used  by some operating
   systems, it  is  EXTREMELY  unwise  to  just  feed
   incoming  batches  to a command interpreter in the
   anticipation that it  will  run  a  command  named
   "rnews" to process the batch.  Unless arrangements
   are made to very tightly  restrict  the  range  of
   commands  that  can be executed by this means, the
   security implications are disastrous.

<P>
          When transmitting news, especially over communications links
          that  are  slow or are billed by the bit, it is often desirable to  batch  news  and  apply  data  compression  to  the
          batches.   Transmission  links  sending  compressed  batches
          <B>SHOULD</B> use out-of-band means of communication to specify the
          compression  algorithm  being  used.   If there is no way to
          send out-of-band information along with a batch, the following encapsulation for a compressed batch MAY be used:
<P>

   ec-batch             = "#! " compression-keyword eol compressed-batch
   compression-keyword  = "cunbatch"

          A  line containing a keyword indicating the type of compression is followed by the compressed batch.   The  only  truly
          widespread  compression  keyword  at  present is "cunbatch",
          indicating compression using  the  widely-distributed  "compress"  program.   Other compression keywords MAY be used by
          mutual agreement between the hosts involved.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> An encapsulated compressed batch is NOT,  in
   general,  a  text  file, despite having an initial
   text line.  This combination of text and  non-text
   data  is  often  awkward  to  handle; for example,
   standard decompression  programs  cannot  be  used
   without  first stripping off the initial line, and
   that in turn is painful to do because  many  texthandling  tools  that  are superficially suited to
   the job do  not  cope  well  with  non-text  data.
   Hence the recommendation that out-of-band communication be used instead when possible.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> For UUCP transmission, where a batch is typically  transmitted by invoking the remote command
   "rnews" with the batch  as  its  input  stream,  a
   plausible out-of-band method for indicating a compression type would be to give a compression  keyword in an option to "rnews", perhaps in the form:
<P>
<PRE>
        rnews -d decompressor
</PRE>
<P>
   where "decompressor" is the name of  a  decompression  program  (e.g. "uncompress" for a batch compressed with "compress" or "gunzip"  for  a  batch
   compressed  with  "gzip").  How this decompression
   program is located and invoked  by  the  receiving
   relayer is implementation-specific.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> See the notes in <A HREF = "#8.1"> section 8.1 </A> on the inadvisability of feeding  batches  directly  to  command

<P>
          It  is  often desirable to transmit news as mail, either for
          the convenience of a human recipient or because that is  the
          only  type of transmission available on a restrictive communication path.
<P>
          Given the similarity between the news format  and  the  MAIL
          format, it is superficially attractive to just send the news
          article as a mail message.  This  is  typically  a  mistake:
          mail-handling  software often feels free to manipulate various headers in undesirable ways  (in  some  cases,  such  as
          Sender,  such  manipulation is actually mandatory), and mail
          transmission problems etc. <B>MUST</B> be reported to the  administrators responsible for the mail transmission rather than to
          the article's author.  In general, news sent as mail  should
          be  encapsulated  to  separate the mail headers and the news
          headers.
<P>
          When the intended recipient is a human, any convenient  form
          of  encapsulation  may  be used.  Recommended practice is to
          use  MIME  encapsulation  with  a  content  type  of   "message/news",  given that news articles have additional semantics beyond what "message/rfc822" implies.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> "message/news" was registered as a  standard
   subtype by IANA 22 June 1993.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          When  mail  is being used as a transmission path between two
          relayers, however, a standard  method  is  desirable.   Currently the standard method is to send the mail to an address
          whose local part is "rnews", with whatever mail headers  are
          necessary  for  successful  transmission.   The news article
          (including its headers) is sent as the body of the mail message, with an "N" prepended to each line.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  The "N" reduces the probability of an innocent line in a news article being taken as a magic
   command  to  mail  software, and makes it easy for
   receiving software to strip off any lines added by
   mail  software (e.g. the trailing empty line added
   by some UUCP mail software).
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          This method has its weaknesses.  In particular,  it  assumes
          that  the  mail  transmission  channel  can transmit nearlyarbitrary body text undamaged.  When mail is being used as a
          transmission  path  of last resort, however, the mail system
          often has inconvenient preconceived notions about the format
          of  message  bodies.   Various  ad-hoc encoding schemes have
          been used to avoid such problems.  The recommended method is
          to  send  a news article or batch as the body of a MIME mail
          message, using content type  "application/news-transmission"
          and MIME's "base64" encoding (which is specifically designed
          to survive all known major mail systems).
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> In the process, MIME  conventions  could  be
   used  to  fragment and reassemble an article which
   is too large to be sent as a single  mail  message
   over  a  transmission  path that restricts message
   length.  In addition, the "conversions"  parameter
   to the content type could be used to indicate what
   (if any) compression method has  been  used.   And
   the Content-MD5 header [rrr 1544] can be used as a
   "checksum" to provide high confidence of detecting
   accidental damage to the contents.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> It might look tempting to use a content type
   such as "message/X-netnews", but  MIME  bans  nontrivial  encodings  of the entire body of messages
   with content type "message".   The  intent  is  to
   avoid obscuring nested structure underneath encodings.  For inter-relayer news transmission,  there
   is  no  nested  structure  of  interest, and it is
   important that the entire article  (including  its
   headers,  not  just its body) be protected against
   the vagaries of intervening mail  software.   This
   situation  appears  to fit the MIME description of
   circumstances in which "application" is the proper
   content type.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>   "application/news-transmission",   with  a
   "conversions" parameter, was registered as a standard subtype by IANA 22 June 1993.

          Most  aspects  of news propagation and processing are implementation-specific.  The basic propagation  algorithms,  and
          certain  details  of  how they are implemented, nevertheless
          need to be standard.
<P>
          There are two important principles  that  news  implementors

          well-known Internet Robustness Principle:
<P><DL><DD><I><B>
   Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.
<P></I></B></DD></DL>
          However, in the case of news there is an even more important
          principle,  derived  from a much older code of practice, the
          Hippocratic Oath (we will thus  call  this  the  Hippocratic
          Principle):
<P>
<P><DL><DD><I><B>
   First, do no harm.
<P></I></B></DD></DL>
<P>
          It  is VITAL to realize that decisions which might be merely

<P>
          <H3><A NAME="9.1">9.1. Relayer General Issues</A></H3>
<P>
          Relayers <B>MUST</B> not alter the content of articles  unnecessarily.   Well-intentioned  attempts  to  "improve" headers, in
          particular, typically do more harm than good.  It is  necessary  for a relayer to prepend its own name to the Path content (see <A HREF = "#5.6"> section 5.6 </A>) and permissible for it to rewrite  or
          delete  the  Xref  header  (see <A HREF = "#6.12"> section 6.12 </A>).  Relayers MAY
          delete the thoroughly-obsolete headers described in <A HREF = "#A.3">appendix
          A.3</A>, although this behavior no longer seems useful enough to
          encourage.  Other  alterations  <B>SHOULD</B>  be  avoided  at  all
          costs, as per the Hippocratic Principle.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  As discussed in <A HREF = "#2.3"> section 2.3 </A>, tidying up the
   headers of a user-prepared article is the  job  of
   the posting agent, not the relayer.  The relayer's
   purpose  is  to  move  already-compliant  articles
   around  efficiently  without  damaging them.  Note
   that in existing  implementations,  specific  programs may contain both posting-agent functions and
   relayer functions.  The distinction is that  posting-agent  functions  are invoked only on articles
   posted  by  local  posters,  never   on   articles
   received from other relayers.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B>  A particular corollary of this rule is that
   relayers should not add headers unless truly  necessary.   In  particular, this is not SMTP; do not
   add Received headers.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Relayers <B>MUST</B> not pass non-conforming articles on  to  other
          relayers,  except  perhaps  in a cooperating subnet that has
          agreed to permit certain kinds of  non-conforming  behavior.
          This  is  a  direct  consequence  of the Internet Robustness
          Principle.
<P>
          The two preceding paragraphs may appear to be  in  conflict.
          What  is  to  be  done  when  a  non-conforming  article  is
          received?  The Robustness Principle argues that it should be
          accepted  but  must not be passed on to other relayers while
          still non-conforming, and the Hippocratic Principle strongly
          discourages  attempts  at  repair.  The conclusion that this
          appears to lead to is correct: a non-conforming article  MAY
          be  accepted  for  local filing and processing, or it MAY be
          discarded entirely, but it <B>MUST</B> not be passed  on  to  other
          relayers.
<P>
          A  relayer  <B>MUST</B> not respond to the arrival of an article by
          sending mail to any destination, other than a local administrator,  except  by explicit prearrangement with the recipient.  Neither posting an article (other than  certain  types
          of control message, see <A HREF = "#7.5"> section 7.5 </A>) nor being the moderator
          of a moderated newsgroup  constitutes  such  prearrangement.
          UNDER  NO  CIRCUMSTANCES WHATSOEVER may a relayer attempt to
          send mail to either an article's originator or a  moderator.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  Reporting apparent errors in message composition is the  job  of  a  posting  agent,  not  a
   relayer.   The  same is true of mailing moderatednewsgroup postings to moderators.  In networks  of
   thousands  of  cooperating  relayers, it is simply
   unacceptable for  there  to  be  any  circumstance
   whatsoever that causes any significant fraction of
   them to simultaneously send mail to the same  destination.   (Some control messages are exceptions,
   although perhaps ill-advised ones.)   What  might,
   in  a smaller network, be a useful notification or
   forwarding becomes a deluge of near-identical messages  that  can  bring mail software to its knees
   and severely  inconvenience  recipients.   Moderators,  in  particular,  historically have suffered
   grievously from this.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Notification of problems in  incoming  articles  MAY  go  to
          local  administrators,  or  at most (by prearrangement!)  to
          the administrators of the neighboring relayer(s) that passed
          on the problematic articles.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  It  would be desirable to notify the author
   that his posting is not propagating as he expects.
   However,  there  is no known method for doing this
   that will scale up  gracefully.   (In  particular,
   "notify  only if within N relayers of the originator" falls down in the presence of commercial news
   services  like  UUNET:  there  may  be hundreds or
   thousands of relayers within a couple of  hops  of
   the  originator.)  The best that can be done right
   now is to notify neighbors, in hopes that the word

   regional monitoring at major hubs.

<P>
          If it is necessary to alter an article, e.g. translate it to

          strenuous efforts should be made to ensure that such  transformations  are reversible, and that relayers or other software that might wish to reverse them know exactly how to  do
          so.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  For  example,  a  cooperating  subnet  that

   ASCII-EBCDIC mapping and take pains to see that it
   is  used  at all points where the subnet meets the
   outside.  If the only reason for using  EBCDIC  is
   that  the readers typically employ EBCDIC devices,

<P>
          <H3><A NAME="9.2">9.2. Article Acceptance And Propagation</A></H3>
<P>
          When a relayer first receives an  article,  it  must  decide
          whether  to  accept it.  (This applies regardless of whether
          the article arrived by itself or as part of a batch, and  in
          principle  regardless  of  whether  it originated as a local
          posting or as traffic from another relayer.)  In a cooperating  subnet  with well-controlled propagation paths, some of
          the tests specified here  MAY  be  delegated  to  centrallylocated  relayers;  that  is, relayers that can receive news
          ONLY via one of the central relayers might  simplify  acceptance  testing based on the assumption that incoming traffic
          has already passed the  full  set  of  tests  at  a  central
          relayer.
<P>
          The  wording that follows is based on a model in which articles arrive on a relayer's host before acceptance tests  are
          done.   However,  depending  on the degree of integration of
          the transport mechanisms and the relayer,  some  or  all  of
          these  tests  MAY  be  done  before  the article is actually
          transmitted, so that articles which definitely will  not  be
          accepted need not be transmitted at all.
<P>
          The  wording  that follows also specifies a particular order
          for the acceptance tests.  While this order is  the  obvious
          one, the tests MAY be done in any order.
<P>
          First,  the  relayer <B>MUST</B> verify that the article is a legal
          news article, with all mandatory headers present with  legal
          contents.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> This check in principle is done by the first
   relayer to see an article, so an article  received
   from  another  relayer should always be legal, but
   there is enough  old  software  still  operational
   that  this  cannot  be  taken for granted; see the
   discussion of the Internet Robustness Principle in
   <A HREF = "#9.1"> section 9.1 </A>.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Second,  the  relayer  <B>MUST</B> determine whether it has already
          seen this article (identified by its message ID).   This  is
          normally  done by retaining a history of all article message
          IDs seen in the last N days, where the value of N is decided
          by  the  relayer's  administrator  but <B>SHOULD</B> be at least 7.
          Since N cannot practically be infinite, articles whose  Date
          content  indicates  that  they  are  older  than  N days are
          declared "stale" and are deemed to have been seen already.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> This check is important because news  propagation  topology  is  typically  redundant,  often
   highly so, and it is not at  all  uncommon  for  a
   relayer  to  receive the same article from several
   neighbors.  The history  of  already-seen  message
   IDs can get quite large, hence the desire to limit
   its length... but it is important that it be  long
   enough  that  slowly-propagating  articles are not
   classed as stale.   News  propagation  within  the
   Internet  is  normally  very  rapid, but when UUCP
   links are involved, end-to-end delays  of  several
   days are not rare, so a week is not a particularly
   generous minimum.
<P>
   <B>NOTE:</B> Despite generally more rapid propagation  in
   recent  times, it is still not unheard-of for some
   propagation paths  to  be  very  slow.   This  can
   introduce the possibility of old articles arriving
   again after they are gone from the history.  Hence
   the "stale" rule.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Third,  the  relayer <B>MUST</B> determine whether any of the article's newsgroups are "subscribed to" by the host, i.e. fit a
          description of what hierarchies or newsgroups the site wants
          to receive.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> This check is significant  because  information  on  what  newsgroups  a  relayer  wishes  to
   receive is often stored at its neighbors, who  may
   not  have  up-to-date  information or may simplify
   the rules for implementation reasons.  As a  hedge
   against  the possibility of missed or delayed newgroup  control  messages,  relayers  may  wish  to
   observe  a notion of a newsgroup subscription that
   is independent of the list of newsgroups  actually
   known to the relayer.  This would permit reception
   and relaying of articles in  newsgroups  that  the
   relayer  is  not  (yet)  aware of, subject to more
   general criteria indicating that they  are  likely
   to be of interest.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Once  an  article  has been accepted, it may be passed on to
          other relayers.  The fundamental news propagation rule is  a
          flooding  algorithm:  on receiving and accepting an article,
          send it to all neighboring relayers not already in its  path
          list that are sent its newsgroup(s) and distribution(s).
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  The path list's role in loop prevention may
   appear relatively unimportant, given that  looping
   articles would typically be rejected as duplicates
   anyway.  However, the path list's role in preventing  superfluous transmissions is not trivial.  In
   particular, the path list is the only  thing  that
   prevents  relayer  X, on receiving an article from
   relayer Y,  from  sending  it  back  to  Y  again.
   (Indeed,  the  usual  symptom  of  confusion about
   relayer names is that incoming news loops back  in
   this  manner.)   The  looping  articles  would  be
   rejected as duplicates, but doubling the  communications  load  on  every news transmission path is
   not to be taken lightly!
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          In general, relayers <B>SHOULD</B> not make  propagation  decisions
          by "anticipation": relayer X, noting that the article's path
          list already contains relayer Y, decides not to send  it  to
          relayer  Z because X anticipates that Z will get the article
          by a better path.  If that is generally true,  then  why  is
          there  a news feed from X to Z at all?  In fact, the "better
          path" may be running slowly or may be down.   News  propagation  is very robust precisely because some redundant transmission is done "just in case".   If  it  is  imperative  to
          limit  unnecessary  traffic  on a path, use of NNTP [rrr] or
          ihave/sendme (see <A HREF = "#7.2"> section 7.2 </A>) to pass  articles  only  when
          necessary  is  better  than  arbitrary decisions not to pass
          articles at all.
<P>
          Anticipation is occasionally  justified  in  special  cases.
          Such  cases  should  involve  both  (1) a cooperating subnet
          whose  propagation  paths  are  well-understood  and   wellmonitored,  with  failures  and  slowdowns noticed and dealt
          with promptly, and (2) a persistent pattern of heavy  unnecessary  traffic on a path that is either slow or costly.  In
          addition, there should be some reason why neither  NNTP  nor
          ihave/sendme is suitable as a solution to the problem.

          <H3><A NAME="9.3">9.3. Administrator Contact</A></H3>

          It is desirable to have a standardized contact address for a

          address   for   mail   administrators.   Mail  addressed  to
          "newsmaster" on a relayer's host <B>MUST</B> go to the  administrator(s)  of  that relayer.  Mail addressed to "usenet" on the

   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> These addresses are case-sensitive, although

   using "usenet" for this purpose, and  so  "usenet"
   should be supported if at all possible (especially
   on  hosts  belonging  to  Usenet!).   The  address

          This raises a more general principle, the single most important issue for gatewaying:
<P><DL><DD><B>
   Above all, prevent loops.
<P></B></DD></DL>
          The  normal  loop prevention of news transmission is vitally
          dependent on the Message-ID header.  Any gateway which finds
          it  necessary  to remove this header, alter it, or supersede
          it (by moving it into the body), <B>MUST</B> take equally effective
          precautions against looping.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> There are few things more effective at turning news readers into a lynch mob than a  malfunctioning  gateway,  or pair of gateways, that takes
   in news articles, mangles them just enough to prevent news relayers from recognizing them as duplicates, and regurgitates them back  into  the  news
   stream.  This happens rather too often.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Gateway  implementors  should realize that gateways have all
          the responsibilities of relayers, plus the  added  complications introduced by transformations between different information formats.  Much of <A HREF = "#9"> section 9 </A>'s discussion  of  relayer
          issues  is  relevant  to  gateways  as well.  In particular,
          gateways <B>SHOULD</B> keep a history of recently-seen articles, as
          described  in <A HREF = "#9.2"> section 9.2 </A>, and not assume that articles will
          never reappear.  This is particularly important for networks
          that  have  their  own  concept  analogous to message IDs: a
          gateway should keep a history  of  traffic  seen  from  BOTH
          directions.
<P>
          If  at  all possible, articles entering the non-news network
          <B>SHOULD</B> be marked in some way so that they will  NOT  be  regatewayed  back into news.  Multiple gateways obviously must
          agree on the marking method used; if it is  done  by  having
          them  know  each others' names, name changes <B>MUST</B> be coordinated with great care.   If  marking  cannot  be  done,  all
          transformations  <B>MUST</B>  be  reversible so that a re-gatewayed
          article is identical to the original (except perhaps  for  a
          longer Path header).
<P>
          Gateways <B>MUST</B> not pass control messages (articles containing
          Control, Also-Control, or Supersedes headers) without removing  the  headers  that  make  them control messages, unless
          there are compelling reasons to believe that they are  relevant  to both sides and that conventions are compatible.  If
          it is truly desirable to pass them unaltered, suitable  precautions  <B>MUST</B> be taken to ensure that there is NO POSSIBILITY of a looping control message.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> The damage done by looping articles is  multiplied  a  thousandfold  if  one  of the affected
   articles is something like a sendsys message  (see
   <A HREF = "#7.3"> section 7.3</A>)  that  requests  multiple  automatic
   replies.  Most gateways  simply  should  not  pass
   control  messages  at all.  If some unusual reason
   dictates doing so, gateway implementors and administrators  are urged to consider bulletproof ratelimiting measures for the  more  destructive  ones
   like  sendsys,  e.g.  passing only one per hour no
   matter how many are offered.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Gateways, like relayers, <B>SHOULD</B> make determined  efforts  to
          avoid mangling articles unnecessarily.  In the case of gateways, some transformations may be  inevitable,  but  keeping
          them  to  a minimum and ensuring that they are reversible is
          still highly desirable.
<P>
          Gateways <B>MUST</B> avoid destroying information.  In  particular,
          the  restrictions  of  <A HREF = "#4.2.2"> section 4.2.2 </A>  are best taken with a
          grain of salt in the context of gateways.  Information  that
          does  not  translate  directly  into  news headers <B>SHOULD</B> be
          retained, perhaps in "X-" headers, both because it may be of
          interest to sophisticated readers and because it may be crucial to tracing propagation problems.
<P>
          Gateway implementors should take particular note of the discussion  of  mailed  replies,  or  more precisely the ban on
          same, in <A HREF = "#9.1"> section 9.1 </A>.  Gateway problems <B>MUST</B> be reported  to
          the  local administration, not to the innocent originator of
          traffic.  "Gateway problems"  here  includes  all  forms  of
          propagation  anomaly  on  the  non-news side of the gateway,
          e.g. unreachable addresses on a  mailing  list.   Note  that
          this  requires  consideration  of  possible  misbehavior  of
          "downstream" hosts, not just the gateway host.
<P>
<P>
          <H3><A NAME="10.2">10.2. Header Synthesis</A></H3>
<P>
          News articles prepared by gateways <B>MUST</B> be legal news  articles.  In particular, they <B>MUST</B> include all of the mandatory
          headers (see <A HREF = "#5"> section 5 </A>)  and  <B>MUST</B>  fully  conform  to  the
          restrictions  on  said  headers.  This often requires that a
          gateway function not only as a relayer, but also partly as a
          posting agent, aiding in the synthesis of a conforming article from non-conforming input.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> The full-conformance requirement needs  particularly  careful attention when gatewaying mailing lists to news, because a number of  constructs
   that are legal in MAIL headers are NOT permissible
   in news headers.  (Note also  that  not  all  mail
   traffic fully conforms to even the MAIL specification.)  The rest of this section will  be  phrased
   in  terms  of mail-to-news gatewaying, but most of
   it is more generally applicable.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          The mandatory headers generally present few problems.
<P>
          If no date information is available, the gateway should supply  a Date header with the gateway's current date.  If only
          partial information is available (e.g. date but  not  time),
          this  should  be fleshed out to a full Date header by adding
          default values, not by mixing in parts of the gateway's current  date.   (Defaults should be chosen so that fleshed-out
          dates will not be in the future!)  It may  be  necessary  to
          map  timezone  information to the restricted forms permitted
          in the news Date header.  See <A HREF = "#5.1"> section 5.1</A>.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> The prohibition of mixing dates  is  on  the
   theory  that  it is better to admit ignorance than
   to lie.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          If the author's address as supplied in the original  message
          is  not suitable for inclusion in a From header, the gateway
          <B>MUST</B> transform it so it is, e.g. by use of the "% hack"  and
          the  domain  address of the gateway.  The desire to preserve
          information is NOT an excuse for violating  the  rules.   If
          the transformation is drastic enough that there is reason to
          suspect loss of information, it may be desirable to  include
          the  original  form  in  an X- header, but the From header's
          contents <B>MUST</B> be as specified in <A HREF = "#5.2"> section 5.2 </A>.
<P>
          If the message contains a Message-ID  header,  the  contents
          should be dealt with as discussed in <A HREF = "#10.3"> section 10.3 </A>.  If there
          is no message ID present, it will be necessary to synthesize
          one, following the news rules (see <A HREF = "#5.3"> section 5.3 </A>).
<P>
          Every  effort should be made to produce a meaningful Subject
          header; see <A HREF = "#5.4"> section 5.4 </A>.  Many news readers select  articles
          to  read  based  on  Subject headers, and inserting a placeholder like "&lt;no subject available&gt;"  is  considered  highly
          objectionable.   Even synthesizing a Subject header by picking out the first half-dozen nouns  and  adjectives  in  the
          article  body  is  better than using a placeholder, since it
          offers SOME indication of what the article might contain.
<P>
          The contents of the Newsgroups header (<A HREF = "#5.5"> section 5.5 </A>) are usually  predetermined  by gateway configuration, but a gateway
          to a network that has its own concept of newsgroups or  discussions might have to make transformations.  Such transformations should be reversible; otherwise confusion is  likely
          on both sides.
<P>
          It  will  rarely  be possible for gateways to provide a Path
          header that is both an accurate history of the relayers  the
          article  has  passed  through  AS  NEWS  and  a usable reply
          address.  The history function <B>MUST</B> be given  priority;  see
          the discussion in <A HREF = "#5.6"> section 5.6 </A>.  It will usually be necessary
          for a gateway to supply an empty path list,  abandoning  the
          reply function.
<P>
          It  is  desirable  for  gatewayed articles to convey as much
          useful information as possible, e.g. by use of optional news
          headers  (see  <A HREF = "#6"> section 6 </A>)  when the relevant information is
          available.  Synthesis of optional headers can generally follow similar rules.
<P>
          Software  synthesizing  References  headers  should note the
          discussion in <A HREF = "#6.5"> section 6.5 </A>  concerning  the  incompatibility
          between  MAIL and news.  Also of interest is the possibility
          of incorporating information from  In-Reply-To  headers  and
          from  attribution  lines in the body; an incomplete or somewhat conjectural References header is much better than  none
          at  all, and reading agents already have to cope with incomplete or slightly erroneous References lists.
<P>
<P>
          <H3><A NAME="10.3">10.3. Message ID Mapping</A></H3>
<P>
          This section, like the previous one, is phrased in terms  of
          mail  being  gatewayed into news, but most of the discussion
          should be more generally applicable.
<P>
          A particularly sticky problem of gatewaying mail  into  news
          is  supplying  legal news message IDs.  Note, in particular,
          that not all MAIL message IDs are legal in  news;  the  news
          syntax  (specified  in <A HREF = "#5.3"> section 5.3 </A>, with related material in
          5.2) is more  restrictive.   Generating  a  fully-conforming
          news  article  from  a mail message may require transforming
          the message ID somewhat.
<P>
          Generation and transformation of message IDs assumes particular  importance  if  a  given mailing list (or whatever) is
          being handled by more than one gateway.  It is highly desirable  that the same article contents not appear twice in the
          same newsgroup, which requires that they  receive  the  same
          message  ID from all gateways.  Gateways <B>SHOULD</B> use the following algorithm (possibly modified by the later  discussion
          of  gatewaying  into  more  than one newsgroup) unless local
          considerations dictate another:
<P>
   1. Separate message ID from surroundings, if necessary.
      A plausible method for this is to start at the first
      "&lt;", end at the next "&gt;", and reject the message  if
      no  "&gt;"  is found or a second "&lt;" is seen before the
      "&gt;".  Also reject the message if the message ID contains no "@" or more than one "@", or if it contains
      no ".".  Also reject the message if the  message  ID
      contains non-ASCII characters, ASCII control characters, or white space.
<P>
        <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> Any legitimate domain will  include  at

        white space in this context when passing mail
        on to non-MAIL software.
   </I></DD></DL>

   2.   Delete the leading "&lt;" and trailing "&gt;".  Separate
        message ID into local part and domain at the  "@".

   3.   In  both  components,  transliterate  leading dots
        (".", ASCII 46), trailing dots, and dots after the
        first  in  sequences  of  two  or more consecutive
        dots, into underscores (ASCII 95).
<P>
   4.   In both components, transliterate disallowed characters  other  than  dots  (see  the definition of
        &lt;unquoted-char&gt; in  <A HREF = "#5.2"> section 5.2 </A>)  to  underscores
        (ASCII 95).
<P>

<P>
          Despite the desire to keep  message  IDs  consistent  across
          multiple  gateways,  there  is also a more subtle issue that
          can require a different approach.  If the same articles  are
          being  gatewayed into more than one newsgroup, and it is not
          possible to arrange that all gateways gateway  them  to  the
          same cross-posted set of newsgroups, then the message IDs in
          the different newsgroups <B>MUST</B> be DIFFERENT.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> Otherwise, arrival  of  an  article  in  one
   newsgroup   will  prevent  it  from  appearing  in
   another, and which newsgroup a particular  article
   appears  in will be an accident of which direction
   it arrives from first.  It is  very  difficult  to
   maintain  a coherent discussion when each participant sees a randomly-selected 50% of the  traffic.
   The  fundamental  problem  here  is that the basic
   assumption behind message IDs is  being  violated:
   the  gateways are assigning the same message ID to
   articles  that  differ  in  an  important  respect
   (Newsgroups header).
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          In  such  cases, it is suggested that the newsgroup name, or
          an agreed-on abbreviation thereof, be prepended to the local
          part  of the message ID (with a separating ".") by the gateway.  This will ensure that multiple gateways  generate  the
          same  message  ID,  while also ensuring that different newsgroups can be read independently.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> It is  preferable  to  have  the  gateway(s)
   cross-post  the  article, avoiding the issue altogether, but this may not be  feasible,  especially

<P>
          Gatewaying mail to news, and vice-versa, is the most obvious
          form  of  news  gatewaying.  It is common to set up gateways
          between news and mail rather too casually.
<P>
          It is hard to go very wrong in gatewaying news into a  mailing  list,  except for the non-trivial matter of making sure
          that error reports go to  the  local  administration  rather
          than to the authors of news articles.  (This requires attention to the "envelope address" as well  as  to  the  message
          headers.)   Doing  the  reverse connection correctly is much
          harder than it looks.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> In particular, just feeding the mail message
   to  "inews -h"  or  the  equivalent is NOT, repeat
   NOT, adequate to gateway mail to  news.   Significant  gatewaying  software  is  necessary to do it
   right.  Not all headers of mail  messages  conform
   to  even  the  MAIL specifications, never mind the
   stricter rules for news.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          It is useful to distinguish between two different  forms  of
          mail-to-news  gatewaying:  gatewaying  a mailing list into a
          newsgroup, and operating a "post-by-mail" service  in  which
          individual  articles can be posted to a newsgroup by mailing
          them to a specific address.  In the first case, the  message
          is  already  being  "broadcast",  and  the  situation can be
          viewed as gatewaying one form of  news  into  another.   The
          second case is closer to that of a moderator posting submissions to a moderated newsgroup.
<P>
          In either case, the discussions in the  preceding  two sections  are relevant, as is the Hippocratic Principle of <A HREF = "#9"> section 9</A>.  However, some additional  considerations  are  specific to mail-to-news gatewaying.
<P>
          As  mentioned  in  <A HREF = "#6"> section 6 </A>, point-to-point headers like To
          and Cc <B>SHOULD</B> not appear as such in  news,  although  it  is
          suggested  that they be transformed to "X-" headers, e.g. XTo and X-Cc, to preserve their information content for  possible  use  by  readers  or  troubleshooters.   The Received
          header is entirely specific to MAIL and  <B>SHOULD</B>  be  deleted
          completely   during   gatewaying,  except  perhaps  for  the
          Received header supplied by the gateway host itself.
<P>
          The Sender header is a tricky case, one  where  mailing-list
          and  post-by-mail  practice  should  differ.  For gatewaying
          mailing lists, the mailing-list host should be considered  a
          relayer,  and  the  From  and Sender headers supplied in its
          transmissions left strictly untouched.  For post-by-mail, as
          for  a  moderator  posting  a  mailed submission, the Sender
          header should reflect the poster rather than the author.  If
          a  post-by-mail  gateway  receives  a  message  with its own
          Sender header, it might wish to preserve the content  in  an
          X-Sender header.
<P>
          It  will  generally be necessary to transform between mail's
          In-Reply-To/References convention and news's References/SeeAlso convention, to preserve correct semantics of cross references.  This also requires attention when going the  other
          way,  from  news to mail.  See the discussion of the difference in <A HREF = "#6.5"> section 6.5 </A>.

<P>
          <H3><A NAME="10.5">10.5. Gateway Administration</A></H3>
<P>
          Any news system will benefit from an  attentive  administrator,  preferably assisted by automated monitoring for anomalies.  This is particularly true of gateways.  Gateway software  <B>SHOULD</B>  be  instrumented  so that unusual occurrences,
          such as sudden  massive  surges  in  traffic,  are  reported
          promptly.   It is desirable, in fact, to go further: gateway
          software <B>SHOULD</B> endeavour to limit damage in the event  that
          the administrator does not respond promptly.
<P>
   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B>  For example, software might limit the gatewaying rate by queueing incoming traffic and  emptying  the  queue  at  a finite maximum rate (well

   raised automatically.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          Traffic gatewayed into a news network <B>SHOULD</B> include a suitable  header,  perhaps  X-Gateway-Administrator,  giving  an

          This  <B>SHOULD</B>  be an address that goes direct to a human, not
          to a "routine administrative issues" mailbox that  is  examined  only  occasionally,  since  the point is to be able to
          reach the administrator quickly in  an  emergency.   Gateway
          administrators  <B>SHOULD</B>  arrange substitutes to cover gateway
          operation (with suitable redirection of mail) when they  are

<P>
          The most obvious form  of  security  problem  with  news  is
          "leakage"  of  articles  which  are  intended  to  have only
          restricted circulation.  The flooding algorithm is EXTREMELY
          good  at finding any path by which articles can leave a subnet  with  supposedly-restrictive  boundaries.   Substantial
          administrative effort is required to ensure that local newsgroups remain local, unless connections to the outside world
          are tightly restricted.
<P>
          A  related problem is that the sendme control message can be
          used to ask for any article by its message ID.  The  usefulness  of  this  has  declined as message-ID generation algorithms have become less predictable, but it remains a potential problem for "secure" newsgroups.  Hosts with such newsgroups may  wish  to  disable  the  sendme  control  message
          entirely.
          The  sendsys,  version,  and  whogets  control messages also
          allow "outsiders"  to  request  information  from  "inside",
          which  may  reveal details of internal topology (etc.)  that
          are considered confidential.  (Note that  at  least  limited
          openness about such matters may be a condition of membership
          in such networks, e.g. Usenet.)
<P>
          Organizations wishing to control these forms of leakage  are
          strongly  advised  to  designate a small number of "official
          gateway" hosts to handle all news exchange with the  outside
          world,  so that a bounded amount of administrative effort is
          needed  to  control  propagation  and  eliminate   problems.
          Attempts  to  keep news out entirely, by refusing to support
          an official gateway, typically result in  large  numbers  of
          unofficial  partial  gateways  appearing  over time.  Such a
          configuration is much more difficult to troubleshoot.
<P>
          A somewhat-related problem is the possibility of proprietary
          material  being  disclosed  unintentionally  by a poster who
          does not realize how far his words  will  propagate,  either
          from  sheer  misunderstanding  or because of errors made (by
          human or software) in followup preparation.  There is little
          that can be done about this except education.

          most of them problems news shares with mail.
<P>
          If  reading  agents  are  careless  about  transmitting nonprintable characters to output  devices,  malicious  posters
          may  post  articles  containing  control sequences ("letterbombs") meant to have various destructive effects on  output
          devices.   Possible  effects  depend on the device, but they
          can include hardware damage (e.g.  by  repeated  writing  of
          values  into configuration memories that can tolerate only a
          limited number of write cycles) and security violation (e.g.
          by  reprogramming  function  keys potentially used by privileged readers).
<P>
          A more sophisticated variation on the letterbomb  is  inclusion  of  "Trojan  horses"  in programs.  Obviously, readers
          must be cautious about using software  found  in  news,  but
          more  subtly,  reading agents must also exercise care.  MIME
          messages can include material that  is  executable  in  some
          sense,  such  as PostScript documents (which are programs!),
          and letterbombs may be introduced into such material.
<P>
          Given the presence of finite resources  and  other  software
          limitations,   some  degree  of  system  disruption  can  be
          achieved by posting  otherwise-innocent  material  in  great
          volume,  either in single huge articles (see <A HREF = "#4.6"> section 4.6 </A>) or
          in a stream of modest-sized articles.  (Some would say  that
          the  steady growth of Usenet volume constitutes a subtle and
          unintentional attack of the latter type;  certainly  it  can
          have  disruptive effects if administrators are inattentive.)
          Systems need some ability to cope with surges, because  single  huge articles occur occasionally as the result of software error, innocent misunderstanding, or deliberate malice,
          and  downtime at upstream hosts can cause droughts, followed
          by floods, of legitimate articles.  (There is also a certain
          amount  of  normal variation; for example, Usenet traffic is
          noticeably lighter on weekends and  during  Christmas  holidays,  and  rises noticeably at the start of the school term
          of North American universities.)  However, a site that  normally  receives  little  traffic  may be quite vulnerable to
          "swamping" attack if its software is insufficiently careful.
<P>
          In  general, careless implementation may open doors that are
          not intrinsic to news.   In  particular,  implementation  of
          control  messages  (see  <A HREF = "#6.6"> sections  6.6</A> and <A HREF="#7"> 7</A>) and unbatchers
          (see <A HREF = "#8.1"> section 8.1 </A> and 
	  <A HREF = "#8.2"> 8.2</A>) via a command interpreter requires
          substantial  precautions  to  ensure  that only the intended
          capabilities are available.  Care must also  be  taken  that
          article-supplied  text  is  not  fed  to  programs that have
          escapes to command interpreters.
<P>
          Finally, there is considerable potential for malice  in  the
          sendsys,  version,  and  whogets control messages.  They are
          not harmful to the hosts receiving them as  news,  but  they
          can  be  used  to  enlist  those hosts (by the thousands) as
          unwitting allies in a mail-swamping attack on a  victim  who
          may  not  even  receive  news.  The precautions discussed in
          <A HREF = "#7.5"> section 7.5 </A> can reduce the potential for such  attacks  considerably,  but  the  hazard cannot be eliminated as long as
          these control messages exist.
<P>
<P>
          <H3><A NAME="11.3">11.3. Anarchy</A></H3>
<P>
          The highly distributed nature of news propagation,  and  the
          lack  of  adequate  authentication protocols (especially for
          use over the less-interactive transport mechanisms  such  as
          UUCP),  make article forgery relatively straightforward.  It
          may be possible to at least track a forgery to  its  source,
          once  it  is recognized as such, but clever forgers can make
          even that relatively difficult.  The assumption  that  forgeries will be recognized as such is also not to be taken for
          granted; readers are notoriously prone to  blindly  assuming
          authenticity.   If  a  forged  article's  initial  path list
          includes the relayer name of the supposed poster's host, the
          article  will  never  be  sent to that host, and the alleged
          author may learn about the forgery secondhand or not at all.
<P>
          A  particularly  noxious form of forgery is the forged "cancel"   control   message.    Notably,   it   is   relatively
          straightforward  to  write  software that will automatically
          send out a (forged) cancel message for any  article  meeting
          some  criterion,  e.g.  written  by  a specific author.  The
          authentication problems discussed in  <A HREF = "#7.1"> section 7.1 </A>  make  it
          difficult to solve this without crippling cancel's important
          functionality.
<P>
          A related problem is the possibility of  disagreements  over
          newsgroup  creation,  on  networks where such things are not
          decided by central authorities.  There have  been  cases  of
          "rmgroup wars", where one poster persistently sends out newgroup messages to create a newsgroup  and  another,  equally
          persistently,  sends  out rmgroup messages asking that it be
          removed.  This is not particularly damaging, if relayers are
          configured  to  be cautious, but can cause serious confusion
          among innocent third parties who just want to  know  whether
          they can use the newsgroup for communication or not.
<P>
<P>
          <H3><A NAME="11.4">11.4. Liability</A></H3>
<P>
          News shares the legal uncertainty surrounding other forms of
          electronic communication:  what  rules  apply  to  this  new
          medium  of  information  exchange?   News  is a particularly
          problematic case because it is  a  broadcast  medium  rather
          than  a point-to-point one like mail, and analogies to older
          forms of communication are particularly weak.
<P>
          Are news-carrying hosts common carriers, like the phone companies, providing communications paths without having either
          authority over or responsibility for content?  Or  are  they
          publishers,   responsible  for  the  content  regardless  of
          whether they are aware  of  it  or  not?   Or  something  in
          between?   Such  questions are particularly significant when
          the content is technically criminal, e.g. some types of sexually-oriented material in some jurisdictions, in which case
          ignorance of its presence may not be an adequate defence.
<P>
          Even in milder situations such as libel or copyright  violation,  the  responsibilities  of  the  poster, his host, and
          other hosts carrying the traffic are unclear.  Note, in particular, the problems arising when the article is a forgery,
          or when the alleged author claims it is a forgery but cannot
          prove this.

          The From header contained the information now found  in  the

          Early  versions of news software following the modern format

<P>
          Relay-Version  contained  version  information   about   the
          relayer  that  last  processed the article.  Posting-Version
          contained version information about the posting  agent  that
          posted  the  article.  Date-Received contained the date when
          the last relayer to process the article first saw it  (in  a

          There once was  a  senduuname  control  message,  resembling
          sendsys  but  requesting  transmission  of the list of hosts
          that the receiving  host  had  UUCP  connections  to.   This
          rapidly  ceased  to  be  of much use, and many organizations
          consider information about their internal connectivity to be
          confidential.
<P>
          Historically,  a  checkgroups  body consisting of one or two
          lines, the first of the form "-n newsgroup",  caused  checkgroups to apply to only that single newsgroup.  This form is
          documented for archeological purposes only; do not use it.

          Historically, an article posted to a  newsgroup  whose  name
          had  exactly  three  components of which the third was "ctl"
          signified that article was to be taken as a control message.
          The  Subject  header  specified the actions, in the same way
          the Control header does now.  This form  is  documented  for

<P>
          MIME defines the following new headers:
<P>
<PRE>
   MIME-Version
   Content-Type
   Content-Transfer-Encoding
   Content-ID
   Content-Description
</PRE>
<P>
<P>
          The MIME-Version header is mandatory for all  messages  conforming  to  the  MIME specification and carries the version
          number of the MIME specification.  Example:
<P>
   MIME-Version: 1.0
<P>
<P>
          The Content-Type header indicates the content  type  of  the
          message.   Content types are split into a top-level type and
          a subtype, separated by a slash.  Auxiliary information  can
          also  be supplied, using an attribute-value notation.  Example:
<P>
<PRE>
   Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
</PRE>
<P>
          (In the absence of a Content-Type header this is in fact the
          default content type.)
<P>
          Important type/subtype combinations are
<P><DL>
<DT>  <B>        text/plain      </B>        
<DD>Plain  text,  possibly  in  a nonASCII character set.<P>
<DT><B>
          text/enriched </B>
          <DD>            A very  simple  wordprocessor-like
                        language    supporting   character
                        attributes  (e.g.,   underlining),
                        justification  control, and multiple character  sets.   (This  proposal  has  gone  through  several
                        iterations and has recently  split
                        off from the main MIME RFCs into a
                        separate document.)

<P>
<DT>  <B>        message/rfc822  </B>          
<DD>A mail  message  conforming  to  a

<P>
<DT>  <B>        message/partial    </B>       
<DD>Part of a message (supporting  the
                        transparent  splitting and joining
                        of  messages  when  they  are  too
                        large to be handled by some transport agent).
<P>
<DT>  <B>        message/external-body  </B>   
<DD>A message whose body is  external.
                        Possible  access  methods  include
                        via mail, FTP, local file, etc.
<P>
<DT>   <B>       multipart/mixed     </B>

                        viewed in serial order.  Each part
                        looks like  an  <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc0822.gz"> RFC 822 </A>  message,
                        consisting  of headers and a body.
                        Most of the <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc0822.gz"> RFC 822 </A>  headers  have
                        no   defined  semantics  for  body
                        parts.
<P>
<DT>   <B>       multipart/parallel     </B>   
<DD>Likewise, except  that  the  parts
                        are  intended to be viewed in parallel (on user agents that support
                        it).
<P>
<DT>  <B>        multipart/alternative   </B>  
<DD>Likewise,  except  that  the parts
                        are intended  to  be  semantically

                        the  environment  should  be  displayed.  For  example,  a  message
                        may  include plain-text, enrichedtext, and postscript  versions  of
                        some document.
<P>
<DT>  <B>        multipart/digest      </B>   
<DD> A variant of multipart/mixed especially   intended   for    message
                        digests  (the  default type of the
                        parts is message/rfc822 instead of
                        text/plain,  saving  on the number
                        of headers for the parts).
<P>
<DT>   <B>       application/postscript </B>  
<DD> A       PostScript       document.
                        (PostScript   is  a  trademark  of
                        Adobe.)
<P>
</DL>
          Other top-level types exist for  still  images,  audio,  and
          video samples.
<P>
          Some  of  the  above  types require the ability to transport
          binary data.  Since the existing message systems usually  do
          not  support this, MIME provides a Content-Transfer-Encoding
          header to indicate the kind of encoding used.  The  possible
          encodings are:
<P><DL>
<DT>   <B>       7bit        </B>     
<DD>    No encoding; the data consists of short
                   (less than 1000  characters)  lines  of
                   7-bit  ASCII  data,  delimited  by  EOL
                   sequences.  This is the default  encoding.
<P>
<DT>    <B>      8bit       </B> 
<DD>         Like  7bit,  except that bytes with the
                   high-order  bit  set  may  be  present.
                   Many  transmission  paths are incapable
                   of carrying  messages  which  use  this
                   encoding.
<P>
<DT> <B>         binary     </B>
<DD>          No  encoding; any sequence of bytes may
                   be present.   Many  transmission  paths
                   are   incapable  of  carrying  messages
                   which use this encoding.
<P>
<DT> <B>         base64     </B>
<DD>          The data  is  encoded  by  representing
                   every  group of 3 bytes as 4 characters
                   from the alphabet "A-Za-z0-9+/",  which
                   was  chosen  for  its  high  robustness
                   through  mail  gateways  (the  alphabet
                   used   by  uuencode  does  not  survive
                   ASCII-EBCDIC-ASCII  translations).   In
                   the final group of 4 characters, "=" is
                   used for those  characters  not  representing  data  bytes.   Line  length is
                   limited and EOLs in  the  encoded  form
                   are ignored.
<P>
<DT> <B>         quoted-printable  </B>
<DD>   Any  byte can be represented by a three
                   character "=XX" sequence where the  X's
                   are   upper  case  hexadecimal  digits.
                   Bytes representing printable 7-bit  USASCII characters except "=" may be represented literally.   Tabs  and  blanks
                   may  be represented literally if not at
                   the end of a line.  Line length is limited,  and  an  EOL preceded by "=" was
                   inserted for this purpose  and  is  not
                   present in the original.
<P></DL>
          The  base64  and  quoted-printable  encodings are applied to
          data in Internet canonical form, which means  that  any  EOL
          encoded  as  anything  but EOL must be an Internet canonical
          EOL:  CR followed by LF.
<P>
          The Content-Description header allows further description of
          a body part, analogous to the use of Subject for messages.
<P>
          Finally,  the  Content-ID  header  can  be used to assign an
          identification to body parts, analogous to the assignment of
          identifications to messages by Message-ID.
          Note  that  most  of  these  headers  are  structured header
          fields, as defined in <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc0822.gz"> RFC 822 </A>.  Consequently,  comments  are
          allowed  in  their  values.   The  following is a legal MIME
          header:
<P>
<PRE>
   Content-Type: (a comment) text (yeah)   /
           plain    (and now some params:) ; charset= (guess what)
      iso-8859-1 (we don't have iso-10646 yet, pity)
</PRE>

   <DL><DD><I><B>NOTE:</B> Although the MIME specification  was  developed for mail, there is nothing precluding its use
   for news as well.  While it might simplify  implementation  to  restrict the MIME headers somewhat,
   in the same way  that  other  news  headers  (e.g.
   From) are restricted subsets of the RFC-822 originals,  this  would  add  yet  another   divergence
   between two formats that ought to be as compatible
   as possible.  In the case  of  the  MIME  headers,
   there  is no body of existing code posing compatibility concerns.   A  full-featured  MIME  reading
   agent needs a full RFC-822 parser anyway, to properly  handle  body  parts  of  types   like   message/rfc822,   so   there   is  little  gain  from
   restricting MIME headers.  Adopting the MIME specification unchanged seems best.  However, articlelevel MIME headers  must  still  comply  with  the
   overall  news header syntax given in <A HREF = "#4"> section 4 </A>, so
   that news software which is NOT interested in MIME
   need not contain a full RFC-822 parser.
   </I></DD></DL>
<P>
          The  second  part  of MIME, <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1522.gz"> RFC 1522 </A> (Representation of NonASCII Text in Internet Message Headers), addresses the problem  of  non-ASCII  characters  in headers.  An example of a
          header using the <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1522.gz"> RFC 1522 </A> mechanism is
<P>
<PRE>
   From: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Andr=E9_?= Pirard &lt;PIRARD@vm1.ulg.ac.be&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
          Such encodings are allowed in selected headers,  subject  to
          the restrictions listed in <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1522.gz"> RFC 1522 </A>.
<P>
          The MIME effort has also produced an RFC defining a ContentMD5 header [rrr 1544], containing an MD5-based "checksum" of
          the  contents of an article or body part, giving high confidence of detecting accidental modifications to the contents.
<P>
          The  "metamail"  software  package  [rrr] helps provide MIME
          support with minimal changes to mailers,  and  may  also  be
          relevant to news reading agents.
<P>
          The PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) effort is pursuing analogous
          facilities to offer stronger  guarantees  against  malicious
          modifications,   unauthorized  eavesdropping,  and  forgery.
          This work  too  may  be  applicable  to  news,  once  it  is
          reconciled with MIME (by efforts now underway).

<P>
          This  Draft  is much longer than <A HREF = "ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/doc/rfc/rfc1036.gz"> RFC 1036 </A>, so there is obviously  much  change  in  content.   Much  of  this  is  just
          increased precision and rigor.  Noteworthy changes and additions include:

<LI> notably, limited From syntax
<LI> MAIL header comments allowed in only a few contexts
<LI> slightly more restricted message-ID syntax
<LI> several more mandatory headers
<LI> duplicate headers forbidden
<LI> References/See-Also   versus   In-Reply-To/References
     (<A HREF = "#6.5">section 6.5</A>)
<LI> case sensitivity in some contexts
<LI> point-to-point  headers,  e.g.  To  and Cc, forbidden
     (<A HREF = "#6">section 6</A>)
<LI> several new headers
